### The Full Quantum Knowledge Graph Experience
This is NOT a "simple" version - it's the complete revolutionary Quantum Knowledge Graph with all features:

1. **Beautiful Quantum Visualization**
   - Animated quantum field with pulsing energy waves
   - Glowing nodes representing quantum entities
   - Dynamic force-directed graph with D3.js
   - Purple/indigo quantum theme with gradients

2. **Four Powerful Views**
   - **Quantum View**: Interactive graph showing family connections
   - **Insights View**: AI-generated insights about your family patterns
   - **Patterns View**: Detected behavioral and temporal patterns
   - **Predictions View**: Future predictions with probability indicators

3. **Real-Time Features**
   - Toggle real-time processing on/off
   - See quantum processors running in background
   - Live updates every 30 seconds when enabled
   - Processing indicators show when analyzing

4. **Quantum Intelligence**
   - Pattern detection running every 30 seconds
   - Predictions updating every minute
   - Learning cycles every 5 minutes
   - Continuous quantum field processing

## Sample Data You'll See:

### Insights:
- "Morning Rush Pattern Detected" - Save 10 minutes by preparing lunch boxes at night
- "Sibling Bond Strengthening" - Joint activities increased 30% this week
