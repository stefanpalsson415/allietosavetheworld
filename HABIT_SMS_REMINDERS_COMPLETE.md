# Habit SMS Reminders - Complete Implementation âœ…

## Overview
The habit system now includes SMS reminder functionality that integrates with the existing phone verification and notification settings.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **SMS Reminder Service** (`HabitReminderService.js`)
- Checks user's phone verification status
- Integrates with notification preferences
- Schedules reminders based on habit timing
- Sends personalized SMS messages via Twilio

### 2. **Habit Setup Flow Integration**
- After choosing visualization (mountain/treehouse), users with verified phones are asked about SMS reminders
- One-click opt-in during habit creation
- Seamless integration with existing flow

### 3. **Notification Settings Integration**
- New SMS Notifications section in User Settings
- Toggle switches for different SMS types:
  - Habit Reminders
  - Event Reminders
  - Task Reminders
- Shows phone number and verification status

### 4. **Cloud Functions for Scheduled Sending**
- `sendScheduledHabitReminders`: Runs every 15 minutes to send due reminders
- `scheduleHabitReminder`: Creates reminder documents when habits are created
- Automatic scheduling for next 7 days

## User Experience Flow

### During Habit Creation:
1. User completes habit setup (Four Laws)
2. Chooses visualization (mountain/treehouse)
3. **If phone verified**: Asked "Would you like SMS reminders?"
   - "ðŸ“± Yes, text me reminders!"
   - "ðŸ”• No thanks, I'll use app reminders"
4. Habit created with SMS preferences saved

### In Settings:
1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Notifications
2. See SMS Notifications section
3. Toggle habit reminders on/off
4. View verified phone number

### Receiving Reminders:
Users get texts like:
```
ðŸ”” After morning coffee

2-min version: Review today's priorities

You got this! ðŸ’ª
```

## Data Structure

### User Preferences:
```javascript
users/{userId}/preferences/notifications
{
  sms: {
    habitReminders: true,
    updatedAt: timestamp
  }
}
```

### Habit Reminders:
```javascript
families/{familyId}/habitReminders/{reminderId}
{
  reminderId: "reminder_habitId_2024-01-15",
  habitId: "habit_12345",
  userId: "user123",
  phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
  habitTitle: "Review priorities",
  habitCue: "After morning coffee",
  scheduledFor: timestamp,
  status: "scheduled" | "sent" | "failed"
}
```

## Security & Privacy

1. **Phone Verification Required**: SMS only sent to verified numbers
2. **User Control**: Can opt-out anytime in settings
3. **Family Scoped**: Reminders stay within family context
4. **No Sensitive Data**: Messages contain only habit cues and encouragement

## Testing the Feature

### Prerequisites:
1. User must have phone verified (Personal Settings)
2. Twilio must be configured with valid credentials
3. Cloud Functions must be deployed

### Test Steps:
1. Create a new habit through Allie chat
2. When asked about SMS reminders, choose "Yes"
3. Check Settings â†’ Notifications to confirm SMS enabled
4. Wait for scheduled time (minus reminder minutes)
5. Receive SMS reminder

## Future Enhancements

1. **Customizable Messages**: Let users personalize reminder text
2. **Smart Timing**: Learn best reminder times from completion data
3. **Reply Handling**: Mark habits complete by replying to SMS
4. **Family Reminders**: Option to remind family helpers
5. **Snooze Function**: Reply "SNOOZE" to delay 15 minutes

## Technical Notes

- Uses existing Twilio integration
- Respects user notification preferences
- Automatic cleanup of old reminders
- Handles timezone considerations
- Graceful fallback if SMS fails
