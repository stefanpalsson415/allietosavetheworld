All critical services that interact with Claude AI have been updated to use the new model. The application should now consistently use `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for all AI operations.

## Next Steps
- Restart any running servers to ensure the changes take effect
- Test key functionality:
  - Chat interactions
  - Email processing
  - Event parsing from images/text
  - Habit generation
  - Survey question generation

## Notes
- Other files found in the search (like test files in public/, mobile app, etc.) were not updated as they appear to be test/utility files not used in production
- The ClaudeService.js already had the correct model, which is good as it's the central service for Claude interactions
