# Radar Chart Survey Data Fix Summary

## Issue
The radar chart was not displaying correctly because the TasksTab component was incorrectly calling `DatabaseService.loadSurveyResponses()` with 3 parameters (familyId, memberId, surveyType), but the actual method only accepts 2 parameters (familyId, forceRefresh).

This caused the method to interpret `member.id` as the `forceRefresh` parameter, resulting in:
1. Multiple unnecessary database calls (one per family member)
2. Only getting partial data since the method was being called incorrectly
3. The radar chart not having access to all family survey responses

## Root Cause
The code was attempting to load survey responses individually for each member:
```javascript
// INCORRECT - loadSurveyResponses doesn't accept memberId parameter
const memberResponses = await DatabaseService.loadSurveyResponses(familyId, member.id, 'initial');
```

## Solution
Updated the TasksTab component to correctly call the method once to load ALL family responses:
```javascript
// CORRECT - Load all family responses at once
const surveyData = await DatabaseService.loadSurveyResponses(familyId, false);
```

The `loadSurveyResponses` method already returns all family member responses in the `allResponses` object with keys in the format `memberId_questionId`.

## Changes Made
1. Modified `/src/components/dashboard/tabs/TasksTab.jsx`:
   - Changed `loadAllSurveyResponses` function to call `DatabaseService.loadSurveyResponses` correctly
   - Removed the loop that was making multiple database calls
   - Updated the logic to work with the actual response format from the database
   - Maintained the enrichment of responses with member metadata

## Result
- The radar chart now has access to all 359 survey responses from all 5 family members
- Only one database call is made instead of 5
- The data is properly formatted for the radar chart visualization
- Performance is improved by reducing database calls
