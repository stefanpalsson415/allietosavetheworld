# Testing Suggested Actions Feature

## Overview
We've implemented a new feature where emails are parsed by Claude AI to extract calendar events and tasks. Instead of automatically creating them (which requires admin permissions), the system now presents "Suggested Actions" that users can review and apply with a single click.

## How to Test

1. **Open the app** at http://localhost:3000

2. **Log in** to your account

3. **Open browser console** (Right-click → Inspect → Console)

4. **Run the test script**:
   ```javascript
   const script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = '/test-suggested-actions.js';
   document.head.appendChild(script);
   ```

5. **Go to the Inbox tab** - You should see a new email with:
   - Subject: "Birthday Party Invitation for Your Child"
   - AI Analysis showing the summary and extracted information
   - A blue "Suggested Actions" section with 4 pending actions:
     - Create calendar event: Birthday Party
     - Create task: RSVP by June 10th
     - Create task: Buy a dog-themed present
     - Create task: Arrange transportation to Jump Yard

6. **Click "Apply All Actions"** button to:
   - Create the calendar event (June 17th at 5pm at Jump Yard)
   - Create 3 tasks in the kanban board
   - All items will be tagged with the parents and include links to view them

7. **After applying**, the actions will move to the "What Allie Did" section showing they were completed

## What Changed

### Before
- Emails were processed by the backend webhook which tried to automatically create calendar events and tasks
- This required Firebase Admin credentials which we didn't have properly configured

### Now
- The backend webhook parses emails and prepares "suggested actions" without executing them
- Users can review the suggested actions in the UI
- Clicking "Apply All Actions" executes them using the user's authenticated session
- This avoids permission issues and gives users control over what gets created

## Benefits
1. **User Control**: Users can review actions before they're created
2. **No Permission Issues**: Actions are created with user's auth, not admin credentials
3. **Transparency**: Users see exactly what Allie wants to do
4. **Flexibility**: Users could potentially edit or skip certain actions (future enhancement)

## Technical Details
- Suggested actions are stored in the `suggestedActions` field on email documents
- Each action has a `status` field: 'pending', 'completed', or 'error'
- The `applyActions` function in UnifiedInbox.jsx handles execution
- After execution, completed actions are also stored in `allieActions` field
