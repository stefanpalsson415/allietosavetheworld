## 📊 What's Left (Phase 5 - UI Only)

### Phase 5: Dual-Pane UI + Visualization
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

#### Files to Create:
1. **`src/components/knowledgeGraph/KnowledgeGraphHub.jsx`** (~300 lines)
   - Dual-pane layout (graph visualization + chat insights side-by-side)
   - Mode switcher (visual graph mode vs chat mode)
   - Real-time sync (click graph node → chat shows insights)

2. **`src/components/knowledgeGraph/VisualGraphMode.jsx`** (~400 lines)
   - D3.js force-directed graph OR Cytoscape.js
   - Interactive node exploration
   - Relationship highlighting on hover
   - Zoom/pan/filter controls
   - Person nodes, Task nodes, Fair Play card nodes

3. **`src/components/knowledgeGraph/ChatInsightMode.jsx`** (~250 lines)
   - Natural language query interface
   - Insight cards (clickable to focus in graph)
   - Recommendation action buttons
   - Export/share functionality

#### What UI Will Show:
- **Visual Graph:** Interactive force-directed layout showing people, tasks, Fair Play cards, relationships
- **Chat Interface:** "Tell me about invisible labor" → Natural language insights
- **Bidirectional Sync:** Click person in graph → Chat shows their insights
- **Recommendation Actions:** "Transfer FP_047 to Michael" → One-click action
- **Beautiful Design:** D3.js animated transitions, Tailwind styling
