## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ The Palsson Family (Your Real Family!)

### **Stefan Palsson** (Parent 1 - Father)
**Age:** Mid-30s to early-40s
**Personality Traits:**
- Well-intentioned but overwhelmed
- Wants to contribute but lacks visibility into what needs doing
- Handles dishes and laundry (visible tasks)
- Work-life balance struggles (Poor rating)
- Underestimates invisible labor (thinks Kimberly carries 43% when she actually carries 87%)

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- **Task Creation:** Creates 15% of family tasks (mostly visible: errands, physical chores)
- **Calendar Usage:** Weekly - adds work meetings, kid pickups when specifically assigned
- **Document Uploads:** Rare - only when explicitly reminded
- **Survey Participation:** 50% completion rate (forgets unless nudged)
- **Response Style:** Brief, action-oriented ("Got it", "On it", "Done")
- **Strengths:** Consistent with assigned tasks (Oly's science club, Tegner's swimming)

- **Calendar Usage:** Daily - manages all 3 kids' activities + family events
- **Document Uploads:** Frequent - vaccination cards, permission slips, medical records
- **Survey Participation:** 95% completion rate (values self-reflection)
- **Response Style:** Detailed, context-rich ("Lillian has volleyball at 4pm, but we need to leave by 3:30 because...")
- **Invisible Work:** Coordinates 3 kids' activities (6+ hours/week), weight score 13.4

### **Lillian Palsson** (Child 1)

## ü§ñ Agent Architecture

### Core Agent Components:

**1. PersonaAgent** (Base class)
```javascript
class PersonaAgent {
  constructor(profile) {
    this.userId = profile.userId;
    this.name = profile.name;
    this.role = profile.role; // 'parent' | 'child'
    this.personality = profile.personality;
    this.behaviorPatterns = profile.behaviorPatterns;
    this.currentState = { mood: 'neutral', energy: 1.0, stress: 0.5 };
  }

  // Core decision-making
  async decideNextAction(context) {
    // Uses Claude API with persona prompt
    // Returns: { action: 'createTask' | 'completeChore' | 'uploadDoc' | 'chat', data: {...} }
  }

  // Simulate time passage
  tick(minutesElapsed) {
    // Update mood, energy, stress based on time and events
  }

  // Respond to Allie's suggestions
  async respondToSuggestion(suggestion) {
    // Personality-based acceptance rate
  }
}
```

**2. StefanAgent extends PersonaAgent**
```javascript
class StefanAgent extends PersonaAgent {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: 'Stefan',
      personality: {
        helpfulness: 0.8,
        awareness: 0.3,  // Low visibility into invisible labor
        followThrough: 0.9,  // High once task is assigned
        initiative: 0.4,  // Needs prompting
        detailOrientation: 0.5
      },
      behaviorPatterns: {
        taskCreationRate: 0.15,  // Creates 15% of tasks
        calendarCheckFrequency: 'weekly',
        surveyCompletionRate: 0.5,
        documentUploadLikelihood: 0.2,
        responseStyle: 'brief'
      }
    });
  }

  async decideNextAction(context) {
    // Stefan-specific decision logic
    // More likely to create tasks on weekends
    // Responds to explicit assignments
    // Underestimates time requirements
  }
}
```

**3. KimberlyAgent extends PersonaAgent**
```javascript
class KimberlyAgent extends PersonaAgent {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: 'Kimberly',
      personality: {
        helpfulness: 1.0,
        awareness: 0.95,  // High visibility into family needs
        followThrough: 0.98,
        initiative: 0.95,
        detailOrientation: 0.9
      },
      behaviorPatterns: {
        taskCreationRate: 0.85,  // Creates 85% of tasks
        anticipationWindow: '3-7 days',  // Plans ahead
        calendarCheckFrequency: 'daily',
        surveyCompletionRate: 0.95,
        documentUploadLikelihood: 0.9,
        responseStyle: 'detailed'
      }
    });
  }

  async decideNextAction(context) {
    // Kimberly-specific logic
    // Anticipates needs (permission slips, appointments)
    // Creates tasks before they become urgent
    // Coordinates multiple activities simultaneously
  }
}
```

**4. ChildAgent extends PersonaAgent** (for Lillian, Oly, Tegner)
```javascript
class ChildAgent extends PersonaAgent {
  constructor(profile) {
    super({
      ...profile,
      personality: {
        curiosity: profile.age < 10 ? 0.9 : 0.6,
        responsibility: profile.age * 0.05,  // Grows with age
        initiative: profile.age * 0.04,
        boredomThreshold: 10 - profile.age  // Younger = bores faster
      }
    });
  }

  // Children have simpler decision trees
  async decideNextAction(context) {
    // Age-appropriate actions
    // Lillian: More independent, creates own tasks
    // Oly: Asks questions, seeks help
    // Tegner: Gets bored, needs activity suggestions
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing EE (External Engineer) User-Driven Process

### **What This Tests:**

1. **Onboarding Flow:** Can EE follow documentation and create agent-driven family?
2. **Persona Definition:** Are personality traits configurable enough?
3. **Behavior Realism:** Do agents create believable family dynamics?
4. **Data Richness:** Does 1 year of simulation generate useful demo data?
5. **Knowledge Graph:** Does Neo4j show meaningful invisible labor patterns?

### **EE Tasks:**

**Task 1: Setup Agent System** (2-4 hours)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk faker moment

# Create Palsson family agents
node scripts/create-agent-family.js --family=palsson

# Verify agent personas loaded correctly
node scripts/verify-agents.js
```

**Task 2: Run 1-Year Simulation** (8-12 hours compute time)
```bash
# Simulate 1 year at 10x speed (36 days real time ‚Üí 1 year sim time)
node scripts/simulate-family-year.js --family=palsson --speed=10x

# OR fast mode: 100x speed (3.6 days real time)
node scripts/simulate-family-year.js --family=palsson --speed=100x --skipWaits
```

**Task 3: Verify Data Quality**
```bash
# Check generated data
node scripts/verify-simulation-data.js --family=palsson

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ 2,400+ calendar events (3 kids √ó 2-3 activities/week √ó 52 weeks)
# ‚úÖ 1,800+ tasks created (Kimberly: 1,530, Stefan: 270)
# ‚úÖ 450+ documents uploaded
# ‚úÖ 100+ chore instances completed
# ‚úÖ 52 weekly surveys completed
# ‚úÖ 12 family meetings logged
# ‚úÖ Knowledge Graph: 5 Person nodes, 2,400+ Task nodes, 3,000+ relationships
