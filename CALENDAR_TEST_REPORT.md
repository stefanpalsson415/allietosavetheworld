## Production Readiness Checklist

✅ **Authentication System**
- Token management fully automated
- Secure storage implementation
- Graceful re-authentication

✅ **Sync Mechanism**
- Bidirectional sync working
- Conflict resolution implemented
- Offline queue functional

✅ **Error Handling**
- All API errors caught
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry with backoff

✅ **Performance**
- Caching implemented
- Batch operations optimized
- Lazy loading for large datasets

✅ **Security**
- Firestore rules configured
- Token encryption active
- Family-level access control

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Firestore Rules**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

3. **Test Production**
   - Navigate to https://checkallie.com
   - Connect Google Calendar
   - Create test event
   - Verify sync

## Known Limitations

1. **Google App Verification** - Shows "unverified app" warning (cosmetic only)
2. **Webhook URL** - Requires server endpoint for real-time sync
