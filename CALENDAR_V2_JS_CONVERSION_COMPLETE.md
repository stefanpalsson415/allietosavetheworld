# ✅ Calendar V2 JavaScript Conversion Complete!

## What We Did

1. **Copied Calendar V2 TypeScript files** to a new directory
2. **Renamed all .ts/.tsx files to .js**
3. **Removed all TypeScript type annotations**:
   - Interfaces and type declarations
   - Type parameters on functions
   - Generic types on hooks (useState, useRef, etc.)
   - Import type statements
   - Type assertions (as Type)
   
4. **Fixed imports** to use .js extensions
5. **Created Calendar.css** for styling
6. **Integrated with existing JavaScript app**
