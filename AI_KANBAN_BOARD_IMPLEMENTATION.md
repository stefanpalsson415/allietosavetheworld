# AI-Powered Kanban Board Implementation

## Overview
We've rebuilt the Kanban board from scratch with deep AI integration, calendar connectivity, and smart task management. The board is now positioned right after "Balance & Habits" (formerly "My Tasks") in the navigation.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Terminology Clarification
- **"Tasks"** = Actionable items on the Kanban board
- **"Responsibilities"** = Workload balance items from surveys (renamed from "tasks")
- Tab renamed: "My Tasks" → "Balance & Habits"

### 2. Board Structure
Five columns optimized for family workflow:
- **Backlog** - Future tasks and ideas
- **This Week** - Weekly focus items
- **Today** - Daily priorities (auto-moves based on due dates)
- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **Done** - Completed (triggers celebration)

### 3. AI Integration

#### Allie Can Create Tasks
Users can say:
- "Create a task for my husband to pick up groceries"
- "What do I need to do today?"
- "Add a task to call the dentist tomorrow"

Allie will:
- Extract task details (title, assignee, priority, due date)
- Create the task on the board
- Add to calendar if there's a due date
- Confirm creation to the user

#### AI Task Suggestions
- Click "AI Suggestions" to get personalized task recommendations
- Based on current workload and family patterns
- One-click to add suggested tasks

#### AI Task Enhancement
- When creating a task, click "AI Assist"
- Allie will suggest:
  - Clear, actionable description
  - Appropriate category
  - Priority level
  - Estimated time
  - Whether it needs a due date

### 4. Calendar Integration
- Tasks with due dates automatically create calendar events
- Events update when tasks move columns
- Completed tasks mark calendar events as done
- Today's tasks automatically move from "This Week" to "Today"

### 5. Knowledge Graph Integration
- Completed tasks are added as achievements
- Links tasks to family members
- Tracks completion patterns over time

### 6. Smart Features

#### Automatic Date-Based Movement
- Tasks due today move to "Today" column automatically
- Overdue tasks are highlighted in red

#### Visual Indicators
- High priority tasks show red alert icon
- AI-created tasks show sparkle icon
- Category badges for quick identification
- Assignee avatars on each card

#### Drag & Drop
- Smooth drag and drop between columns
- Visual feedback during dragging
- Automatic position saving

#### Quick Actions
- Double-click title to edit inline
- Click checkbox to toggle completion
- Menu for edit/delete options

### 7. Filtering & Search
- Search by task title or description
- Filter by assignee
- Filter by tasks with dates
- Real-time filtering updates

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. **AIKanbanBoard.jsx** - Main board component
2. **AITaskCard.jsx** - Individual task cards with drag capability
3. **AITaskColumn.jsx** - Column containers with drop zones
4. **AITaskCreator.jsx** - Smart task creation modal with AI assist

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Allie Chat → Extract Details → Create Task Event
                                                ↓
Firestore ← Save Task ← Calendar Event ← Task Board Updates
                ↓
        Knowledge Graph Update
```

### Integration Points
- **Firestore Collection**: `kanbanTasks`
- **Calendar Service**: Creates/updates events for dated tasks
- **Knowledge Graph**: Tracks completions and patterns
- **Allie Chat**: Natural language task creation

## Usage Examples

### For Users
1. **Quick Task Creation**
   - Click "Add Task" or tell Allie
   - Use AI Assist for better task details
   - Assign to family members
   - Set due dates for calendar integration

2. **Daily Workflow**
   - Check "Today" column each morning
   - Drag tasks between columns as you work
   - Mark complete for celebration animation

3. **AI Assistance**
   - "What should I focus on today?"
   - "Create a task for John to mow the lawn this weekend"
   - "Show me my overdue tasks"

### For Families
- Parents can create tasks for each other
- Track household responsibilities separately from balance survey
- See who's working on what in real-time
- Celebrate completions together
