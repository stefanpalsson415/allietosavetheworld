## üîç Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Check if you need to select a specific family member** - Some features might only show for certain roles (parent vs child)

2. **Verify the Home tab content**:
   - Is the transparency report section visible?
   - Is it maybe below the fold (need to scroll)?

3. **Check the header for chat button**:
   - It should be in the top-right near the user avatar
   - Might be an icon instead of text

4. **Verify calendar permissions**:
   - Add Event might only show for parents
   - Check if you're viewing as a parent account

### Quick Manual Verification:
Please manually check in your browser:
1. Can you see "View full transparency report" on the Home tab?
2. Can you see your user avatar with a dropdown in the sidebar?
3. Is there a chat button in the header (top right)?
4. On the calendar, is there an "Add Event" or "+" button?
