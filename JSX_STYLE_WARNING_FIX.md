# JSX Style Warning Fix âœ…

## Issue
React warning: `Received 'true' for a non-boolean attribute 'jsx'`

This was caused by using styled-jsx syntax without the proper babel configuration:
```jsx
<style jsx>{`
  /* styles */
`}</style>
```

## Fix
Changed to regular style tag:
```jsx
<style>{`
  /* styles */
`}</style>
```

## Result
- Warning is now resolved
- Styles still work as expected
- No need for additional babel plugins

## Note on Calendar Event Guard Messages
The messages like "Calendar event guard blocked getEventsForUser call" are just warnings from the infinite loop protection system. They don't affect habit loading since habits are stored in a separate collection (`habits2`).

These warnings appear when:
- Multiple components try to load events simultaneously
- The system prevents potential infinite loops
- Events will still load after the cooldown period

No action needed for these warnings - they're working as designed to prevent performance issues.
