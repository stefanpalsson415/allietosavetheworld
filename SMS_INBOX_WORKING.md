# SMS Inbox - Working! âœ…

## Summary
The SMS inbox is now fully functional. Messages sent to the Allie phone number are:
1. Received by the webhook
2. Saved to the database with correct familyId
3. Displayed in the unified inbox
4. Auto-processed with AI for actionable items

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Document Real-time Updates
- Added Firestore listeners to FamilyInbox component
- Documents now update from "Queued" to "Processed" without refresh

### 2. Contact Visibility
- Fixed collection name mismatch ('contacts' vs 'familyContacts')
- Contacts parsed from emails now appear correctly

### 3. SMS Display Issues
- Fixed UnifiedInbox to display SMS `body` field
- Enhanced phone number formatting for Swedish numbers
- Fixed archived SMS filtering
- Ensured all SMS have correct familyId

## How to Send SMS to Allie

### Option 1: From Your Phone
- Send SMS to: **+1 (719) 748-6209**
- Messages appear in inbox within seconds

### Option 2: From Test Interface
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/test-allie-sms.html
2. Enter your phone number and message
3. Click "Send Test SMS"

### Option 3: Direct Webhook Test (Browser Console)
```javascript
await fetch('/test-webhook-directly.js').then(r => r.text()).then(eval)
```

## Troubleshooting

If SMS don't appear:
1. Check if server is running: `cd server && npm start`
2. Verify familyId is correct: `localStorage.getItem('selectedFamilyId')`
3. Check for archived messages: `await fetch('/check-archived-sms.js').then(r => r.text()).then(eval)`
4. Fix any SMS without familyId: `await fetch('/simple-sms-fix.js').then(r => r.text()).then(eval)`

## Next Steps
- SMS messages are automatically processed with AI
- Allie extracts calendar events, tasks, and reminders
- Responses are sent back via SMS when actions are taken
