# Family Dashboard Tab

## What this tab is for
The Family Dashboard serves as the central hub for monitoring family health, progress, and insights. For parents, it provides comprehensive visualizations of family dynamics, survey responses, and workload distribution across various categories, enabling informed decisions about family management. For children, it offers a simplified view highlighting achievements, upcoming events, and family milestones. The dashboard aggregates data from multiple sources to present actionable insights about family balance and well-being.

## How the entire tab works end-to-end

### User Journey
1. User navigates to Dashboard â†’ Family Dashboard tab
2. Tab initializes and loads personalized content based on user role (parent vs. child)
3. Dashboard components fetch data from multiple sources (surveys, tasks, events, habits)
4. Visualizations render with aggregated metrics and insights
5. User can interact with charts, filter data, and view detailed breakdowns
6. Dashboard updates in real-time as family members complete tasks or surveys

### State & Data Flow
- **Context Providers**: Uses `FamilyContext`, `SurveyContext`, and `EventContext`
- **Hooks**: `useFamilyKnowledgeGraph()` for relationships, `useSurveyAnalysis()` for patterns
- **State Flow**:
  - Initial load: `DashboardTab` fetches family metrics and distributes to child components
  - Data aggregation: Raw data from multiple collections transformed into visualization formats
  - Insight generation: AI service processes metrics to generate actionable recommendations
  - Refresh cycle: Dashboard auto-refreshes data at configurable intervals

### API Sequence
1. **Load Family Profile**: `GET /families/{id}` - Retrieves core family structure data
2. **Load Metrics**: `GET /familyMetrics/{id}` - Fetches dashboard metrics and KPIs
3. **Load Task Data**: `GET /tasks?familyId={id}` - Retrieves task assignment and completion data
4. **Load Survey Results**: `GET /surveyResponses?familyId={id}` - Gets aggregated survey data
5. **Load Calendar Events**: `GET /events?familyId={id}&future=true&limit=10` - Gets upcoming events
6. **Generate Insights**: `POST /ai/generate-insights` - Processes data to create recommendations
7. **Load Habits Data**: `GET /habits?familyId={id}` - Retrieves habit tracking information
8. **Save Dashboard State**: `UPDATE /userPreferences/{id}` - Saves dashboard configuration

### Side-effects & Cross-tab Links
- **Calendar Tab**: Events data shared between Calendar and Dashboard widgets
- **Tasks Tab**: Task completion affects workload balance visualizations
- **Chore System**: Chore and reward data feeds into completion metrics
- **Knowledge Graph**: User interactions with dashboard create relationship graph edges
- **Notifications**: Notable insights may trigger notification recommendations
- **Survey System**: Completion of surveys updates dashboard metrics in real-time

### Failure & Edge Cases
- **Data Sparsity**: Shows placeholder visualizations with guidance when insufficient data exists
- **Network Offline**: Uses cached metrics with timestamp indicators for offline mode
- **Permission Control**: Filters sensitive metrics based on user role and age
- **Empty States**: Provides onboarding guidance when no data is available for visualization
- **Stale Data**: Implements refresh controls with time-since-update indicators
