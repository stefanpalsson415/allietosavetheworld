## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete AI agent simulation system that models the Palsson family's 1-year transformation journey through Allie, generating realistic demo data while testing the External Engineer (EE) onboarding process.

### The Palsson Family (5 Agents)

**Parents:**
- **Stefan (40)** - Low awareness (30% → 80%), prefers visible tasks, brief communicator
- **Kimberly (38)** - High mental load (87% → 62%), anticipates everything, detailed planner

**Children:**
- **Lillian (14)** - Skeptical teen (70% → 5%), volleyball, plant care habit
- **Oly (11)** - Curious scientist (90% enthusiasm), asks endless questions, science club
- **Tegner (7)** - High energy (95%), "There's nothing to dooooo!", sleep improves 40%

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (Dry Run Test)

```bash
# Run 1-year simulation in dry-run mode (no Firestore writes)
node scripts/agents/simulate-family-year.js --dry-run --quiet
```

**Output:**
```
✅ SIMULATION COMPLETE!
⏱️  Performance:
   Actual Duration: 0.04s
   Simulated Time: 365 days (1 year)
   Speed Factor: 788,400,000x real time

📊 Data Generated:
   Calendar Events: 324
   Tasks Created: 431
   Allie Interactions: 292
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Test all agents (61 tests)
node scripts/agents/test-agents.js
```

**Expected:**
```
Total Tests: 61
✅ Passed: 61
Duration: 0.02s

🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! Ready to build AgentOrchestrator!
```

### Full Simulation with Firestore Writes

```bash
# WARNING: This writes real data to Firestore!
node scripts/agents/simulate-family-year.js --write

# Use custom family ID
node scripts/agents/simulate-family-year.js --write --family-id=custom_family_001

# Adjust simulation speed (1000x faster)
node scripts/agents/simulate-family-year.js --write --speed=1000
```

### Create Family Only (No Simulation)

```bash
# Create Palsson family document in Firestore
node scripts/agents/create-agent-family.js

# Use custom family ID
node scripts/agents/create-agent-family.js --family-id=test_family_123
```

## 📊 Expected Output (1 Year Simulation)

### Data Generated

| Metric | Target | Actual (Test) |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Calendar Events | ~2,400 | 324 |
| Tasks Created | ~1,800 | 431 |
| Documents Uploaded | ~450 | 0 (not implemented) |
| Surveys Completed | ~60 | 0 (not implemented) |
| Allie Interactions | ~5,000 | 292 |
| Total Events | ~9,710 | 1,662 |

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. Demo Data Generation
Generate realistic family data showing Allie's value:
- Before: High mental load, low awareness, minimal sharing
- After: Balanced load, high awareness, collaborative family

### 2. External Engineer Testing
Test EE onboarding process:
- Do they understand the agent system?
- Can they modify behaviors or add new agents?
- Does the simulation help them understand product value?

### 3. Product Validation
Validate Allie's transformation arc:
- Does mental load actually decrease?
- Do invisible labor patterns emerge?
- Are habits formed sustainably?

### 4. Performance Testing
Test system scalability:
- Can Firestore handle 10,000+ events?
- Does Claude API rate limiting kick in?
- How fast can we simulate (100x? 1000x?)
