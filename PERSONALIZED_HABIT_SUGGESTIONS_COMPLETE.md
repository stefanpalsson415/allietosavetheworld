# Personalized Habit Suggestions - Complete Implementation ‚úÖ

## Overview
The habit setup flow now generates fully personalized suggestions at every step using Claude AI, based on the family's actual data, routines, and member names.

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
When generating suggestions, the system gathers:
- Family name and all member details (names, ages, roles)
- Survey responses and insights
- Task history and patterns
- Completed weeks in the program
- Previous answers in the habit setup flow

### 2. **Claude-Powered Personalization**
Each step sends a detailed prompt to Claude with:
- Specific family context
- Current habit being created
- Previous answers
- Examples using actual family member names

### 3. **Personalized Suggestions at Each Step**

#### Step 1: Make it Obvious (When/Where)
```javascript
Examples generated:
- "After Stefan drops Emma at school"
- "During Stefan's coffee break at 10am"
- "Before family dinner prep at 5:30pm"
- "After putting Emma and Lucas to bed"
```

#### Step 1b: Visual Reminders
```javascript
Examples generated:
- "‚è∞ Set phone alarm for after morning coffee"
- "üìù Emma can put sticky note on Stefan's coffee mug"
- "üìÖ Add to family calendar with Stefan and Maria as attendees"

```

#### Step 2: Make it Attractive

- "üèÜ Race with Emma and Lucas to see who finishes first"

- "üç´ Emma picks tonight's dessert if Stefan completes habit"
```

#### Step 3: Make it Easy (2-minute version)
```javascript

- "Write 3 things Stefan is grateful for"
- "Stefan and Emma pick up 5 toys together"
- "Plan tomorrow's outfit with Emma and Lucas"
- "Send one email about researching services"
```

#### Step 4: Make it Satisfying (Rewards)
```javascript

- "üéÜ Family celebrates with Stefan's victory dance"
- "üí¨ Text Maria 'Researching services done!'"
- "üç™ Stefan gets first pick of evening snacks"
```

#### Step 5: Schedule It
```javascript
Examples generated:
- "üìÜ Every morning after Emma's school drop-off"
- "üëî Weekdays when Stefan works from home"
- "üèñÔ∏è Saturdays during Emma and Lucas's screen time"

## Implementation Details

### generatePersonalizedSuggestions Function
```javascript
const generatePersonalizedSuggestions = async (step, habitContext, previousAnswers = {}) => {
  // Gather comprehensive family data
  const familyData = {
    familyName: familyName,
    members: familyMembers.map(m => ({
      name: m.name,
      role: m.role,
      age: m.age,
      interests: m.interests
    })),
    currentUser: selectedUser?.name,
    surveyData: surveyResponses,
    taskHistory: taskRecommendations
  };

  // Build personalized prompt with examples
  let prompt = `You are helping ${selectedUser?.name} from the ${familyName} family...`;
  
  // Add step-specific guidance with examples using family names
  switch (step) {
    case 'obvious':
      prompt += `Generate when/where cues like "After ${selectedUser?.name} drops ${child?.name} at school"`;
      break;
    // ... etc for each step
  }

  // Get Claude's response
  const response = await ClaudeService.generateResponse(...);
  
  // Parse and return suggestions
  return JSON.parse(response);
};
```
