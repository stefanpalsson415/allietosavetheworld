# Habit Coaching Flow - Implementation Complete âœ…

## What Was Done

Modified AllieChat to provide step-by-step habit coaching when creating habits from the radar chart, making Allie act as a personal coach through the Four Laws of Behavior Change.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Habit Setup State Management**
Added state variables to track the coaching conversation:
```javascript
const [habitSetupState, setHabitSetupState] = useState(null);
const [habitSetupAnswers, setHabitSetupAnswers] = useState({});
const [habitSetupQuestions] = useState(HabitSetupFlow().questions);
```

### 2. **Intercepting Habit Creation**
Modified `handleNewPrompt` to detect habit creation requests:
- Checks for `habitContext` in the prompt event
- Initializes the coaching flow with Step 1
- Stores habit context (title, description, category, etc.)

### 3. **Step-by-Step Coaching Flow**
Modified `handleSend` to process user responses through each step:

1. **Make it Obvious (Cue)**
   - Asks for specific when/where
   - Then asks about visual reminders (phone, calendar, sticky notes, etc.)

2. **Make it Attractive**
   - Suggests pairing strategies
   - Asks what would make it enjoyable

3. **Make it Easy**
   - Asks for 2-minute version
   - Then asks for ideal full duration

4. **Make it Satisfying**
   - Offers immediate reward options
   - Allows multiple selections

5. **Schedule It**
   - Frequency selection (daily, weekdays, custom)
   - Time of day
   - Custom days if needed

6. **Identity Statement**
   - "I am someone who..." completion
   - Connects habit to personal identity

7. **Family Support**
   - Kids can help option (earn 4 Bucks)

8. **Progress Visualization**
   - Mountain climbing or treehouse building

### 4. **Natural Language Processing**
Each step intelligently parses user responses:
- Recognizes keywords for cues (phone, calendar, sticky)
- Extracts duration numbers
- Identifies reward types
- Parses days of the week
- Detects yes/no responses

## User Experience Flow

1. User clicks "Researching services" in radar chart
2. Allie opens with: "Great choice! Let's set up your habit..."
3. Allie guides through each step, waiting for responses
4. User types natural responses like "after morning coffee"
5. Allie acknowledges and moves to next step
6. After all steps, habit is created with all Four Laws configured
7. Success message with calendar integration

## Benefits

- **Personal Coaching Feel**: Allie acts as a coach, not just a form
- **Educational**: Users learn the Four Laws naturally
- **Flexible Input**: Natural language responses, not rigid forms
- **Engaging**: Conversational flow keeps users engaged
- **Complete Setup**: All habit details configured through conversation

## Example Conversation

**Allie**: "First, let's decide when and where you'll practice this habit. Be specific!"

**User**: "Every Wednesday morning after dropping kids at school"

**Allie**: "Perfect! 'Every Wednesday morning after dropping kids at school' is a great cue. Now, what visual reminders can help you remember?"

**User**: "Phone reminder and I'll put a sticky note on my car dashboard"

**Allie**: "Great setup! I'll help you with those reminders. ðŸŽ¯ Now let's make this habit something you'll actually look forward to!"

... and so on through all steps

## Technical Notes

- Maintains conversation state throughout the flow
- Handles edge cases (custom days, no matches, etc.)
- Integrates with existing HabitService2 for creation
- Dispatches events for UI updates
- Clears state after completion or error
