# Phone Verification Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Button Label Issue
**Problem**: The "Continue" button on the phone verification step wasn't showing "Send Verification Code" when appropriate.

**Fix**: 
- Updated button text logic to show "Send Verification Code" when phone number is entered but code hasn't been sent
- Changed line 1913 to use clearer text

### 2. Missing State Initialization
**Problem**: `phoneSmsCodeSent` state wasn't initialized, causing undefined behavior.

**Fix**: 
- Added `phoneSmsCodeSent: false` to initial state (line 30)

### 3. Verification Code Digit Count
**Problem**: UI said "6-digit code" but Twilio sends 4-digit codes.

**Fix**: 
- Changed placeholder text from "Enter 6-digit code" to "Enter 4-digit code" (line 1697)
- Updated maxLength from "6" to "4" (line 1700)

### 4. Unclear Verification Flow
**Problem**: Users couldn't easily send verification code - had to click "Continue" which was confusing.

**Fix**: 
- Added a dedicated "Send Verification Code" button inside the phone verification step (lines 1756-1797)
- This button appears when a phone number is entered
- The main navigation button now properly shows different states

### 5. Improved NextStep Logic
**Problem**: The phone verification logic in nextStep was complex and could fail silently.

**Fix**: 
- Refactored the phone verification logic in nextStep function (lines 609-661)
- Added clearer error messages
- Better separation of concerns between sending SMS and verifying codes

## How Phone Verification Now Works:

1. User enters phone number
2. A blue "Send Verification Code" button appears below the SMS features info
3. User clicks button to send code
4. UI switches to show verification code input
5. User enters 4-digit code and clicks "Verify Code"
6. Once verified, user can click "Continue" to proceed

## Button States:
- No phone number entered: "Continue" (allows skipping)
- Phone entered, no code sent: "Send Verification Code" shown on main button
- Code sent, not verified: "Waiting for verification..." (disabled)
- Verified or skipped: "Continue"

The skip checkbox remains available throughout the process.
