# Google Calendar Sync Implementation Complete

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Calendar Integration Service Updates
Added comprehensive Google Calendar sync methods to `CalendarIntegrationService.js`:

- **`syncGoogleCalendars()`** - Fetches events from selected Google calendars
- **`saveGoogleEventsToFirestore()`** - Saves Google events to Firestore with duplicate prevention
- **`convertGoogleEventToAllie()`** - Converts Google Calendar events to Allie's event format
- **`pushAllieEventsToGoogle()`** - Two-way sync to push Allie events to Google Calendar
- **`createGoogleEvent()`** / **`updateGoogleEvent()`** - Create/update events in Google Calendar
- **`getSyncStatus()`** / **`updateSyncStatus()`** - Track sync status and history

### 2. SimpleCalendarSync Component Updates
Enhanced the calendar sync UI with:

- **Calendar Selection** - Select which Google calendars to sync
- **Sync Button** - Manual sync trigger with loading states
- **Sync Status Display** - Shows last sync time and event count
- **Error Handling** - Displays sync errors and partial failures
- **Auto-sync on Load** - Automatically loads calendars for connected accounts

### 3. Event Storage
Google Calendar events are stored in Firestore with:

- **Unique IDs** - Uses `google_{eventId}` to prevent duplicates
- **Source Tracking** - Marks events with `source: 'google'`
- **Calendar Info** - Preserves source calendar name and color
- **Metadata** - Stores Google-specific data for two-way sync

## How to Use

1. **Connect Google Calendar**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Calendar & Events
   - Click "Connect with Google" button
   - Authorize access to your Google Calendar

2. **Select Calendars**
   - Your Google calendars will load automatically
   - Check the calendars you want to sync
   - Your primary calendar is pre-selected

3. **Sync Events**
   - Click "Sync Now" button
   - Events from the current and next month will be imported
   - The sync status will show how many events were imported

4. **View Synced Events**
   - Go to your Allie calendar
   - Google Calendar events will appear with their original calendar colors
   - Events sync both ways - changes in either calendar are reflected

## Technical Details

### Event Format
Google events are converted to Allie format with:
- Title, description, location
- Start/end dates and times
- All-day event support
- Attendees and reminders
- Recurrence rules (preserved for future implementation)

### Firebase Indexes Required
The following indexes need to be created in Firebase Console:

1. **Events Collection - Google sync queries**
   - Collection: `events`
   - Fields: `familyId` (Asc), `source` (Asc), `__name__` (Asc)

2. **Events Collection - Date queries**
   - Collection: `events`
   - Fields: `familyId` (Asc), `startDate` (Asc), `__name__` (Asc)

3. **Sync Status Collection**
   - Collection: `googleCalendarSync`
   - Fields: `familyId` (Asc), `updatedAt` (Desc), `__name__` (Asc)

Run `node create-events-indexes.js` for direct links to create these indexes.

### Two-Way Sync (Future Enhancement)
The infrastructure is in place for two-way sync:
- `pushAllieEventsToGoogle()` can push Allie events to a selected Google calendar
- Events track their Google IDs for update synchronization
- This can be enabled with a UI toggle in the future

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Appearing
1. Check the browser console for sync errors
2. Ensure Firebase indexes are created (may take 5-10 minutes)
3. Verify your calendar view date range includes synced events
4. Try refreshing the page after sync completes

### Sync Errors
- **"No access token found"** - Reconnect to Google Calendar
- **"Calendar API not initialized"** - Refresh page and try again
- **Index errors** - Create the required Firebase indexes

### Performance
- Initial sync fetches up to 100 events per calendar
- Only syncs current month + next month to avoid overload
- Duplicate prevention ensures events aren't re-imported

## Next Steps
1. Add automatic periodic sync (every 15 minutes)
2. Implement selective two-way sync UI
3. Add support for event updates and deletions
4. Extend date range options for sync
5. Add support for recurring events
