# Google Calendar Sync Fix Complete

## Summary
Fixed Firebase validation errors that were preventing Google Calendar events from being saved during sync. The sync was successfully fetching events from Google Calendar but Firebase was rejecting them due to undefined values in the event data.

## Problem
When clicking "Sync Now" after selecting Google calendars, the following error occurred repeatedly:
```
Function WriteBatch.set() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined
```

This error was happening for various Google Calendar event fields like:
- `visibility`
- `recurringEventId`
- `originalStartTime`
- `organizer`
- `status`

## Root Cause
Google Calendar API returns some optional fields as `undefined` when they're not set. Firebase Firestore does not allow `undefined` as a field value - it requires either a valid value or the field to be omitted entirely.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `cleanUndefinedValues` Helper Function
Created a recursive function in `CalendarIntegrationService.js` that removes all undefined values from objects before saving to Firebase:

```javascript
static cleanUndefinedValues(obj) {
  if (obj === null || obj === undefined) {
    return null;
  }
  
  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
    return obj.map(item => this.cleanUndefinedValues(item)).filter(item => item !== undefined);
  }
  
  if (typeof obj === 'object' && obj.constructor === Object) {
    const cleaned = {};
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
      if (value !== undefined) {
        const cleanedValue = this.cleanUndefinedValues(value);
        if (cleanedValue !== undefined) {
          cleaned[key] = cleanedValue;
        }
      }
    }
    return cleaned;
  }
  
  return obj;
}
```

### 2. Applied Cleaning to Event Conversion
Modified the `convertGoogleEventToAllie` method to:
- Clean the `googleMetadata` object
- Clean the entire event object before returning
- Clean attendee objects to ensure no undefined values

### 3. Updated Firebase Indexes
Created comprehensive index documentation in `create-events-indexes.js` for all required queries:
- Events by familyId + source (for sync queries)
- Events by familyId + status + startTime (for calendar view)
- Events by familyId + startTime (for date range queries)
- Events by familyId + dateTime (for legacy queries)
- Events by familyId + startDate (for date-based queries)

## Testing

### 1. Verify the Fix
Run this in the browser console:
```javascript
// Load: /public/test-google-sync-fix.js
```

### 2. Check Sync Status
Run this in the browser console:
```javascript
// Load: /public/check-google-sync.js
```

### 3. Verify Synced Events
Run this in the browser console:
```javascript
// Load: /public/verify-google-events.js
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Sync**:
   - Go to Settings > Calendar & Events
   - Make sure calendars are selected
   - Click "Sync Now"
   - Watch the console for any errors

2. **Create Firebase Indexes**:
   - Run `node create-events-indexes.js` to see required indexes
   - Create them in Firebase Console or click links in any index errors

3. **Verify Events Display**:
   - After successful sync, go to the Calendar tab
   - Google Calendar events should appear with a "google" source badge
   - The calendar view automatically refreshes when sync completes

## Additional Notes

- The CalendarProvider listens for 'calendar-sync-completed' events and automatically refreshes
- Events are saved with status 'active' to match CalendarServiceV2 queries
- Google event IDs are prefixed with 'google_' to prevent duplicates
- The sync fetches events for the current month and next month
- Two-way sync capability is built in but not yet enabled in the UI
