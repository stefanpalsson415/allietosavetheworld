## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Phase 1: Survey Response Collection
**Goal:** Verify responses are captured and stored correctly

#### Test 1.1: Initial Survey Load
```javascript
// Expected Behavior:
- User clicks "Take the Initial Survey"
- 72 personalized questions load
- No permission errors in console
- Progress counter shows "0/72 votes recorded"

// Validation Points:
✓ Check: personalizedQuestions.length === 72
✓ Check: No Firebase permission errors
✓ Check: Questions personalized to family structure
```

#### Test 1.2: Response Recording
```javascript
// Test Steps:
1. Answer first question (select "Mama")
2. Verify counter updates to "1/72"
3. Answer 5 more questions with mixed responses
4. Verify counter shows "6/72"

// Database Validation:
- Check surveyResponses collection has entries
- Check localStorage has surveyInProgress_[userId]
- Verify responses format: { questionId: "Mama"|"Papa"|"Both" }
```

#### Test 1.3: Progress Persistence
```javascript
// Test Steps:
1. Answer 10 questions
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify progress restored correctly
4. Continue from question 11

// Validation:
✓ localUserResponses restored from localStorage
✓ Current question index correct
✓ Previous answers displayed in question list
```

---

### Phase 2: ELO Rating Calculations
**Goal:** Verify workload imbalances are calculated correctly

#### Test 2.1: Rating Updates
```javascript
// Test Case: Heavy Mama Skew
- Answer 10 questions: 8 "Mama", 2 "Papa"
- Expected ELO Changes:
  * Mama rating increases (>1500)
  * Papa rating decreases (<1500)
  * Category ratings diverge

// Validation Query:
const ratings = await ELORatingService.getFamilyRatings(familyId);
console.log('Mama Global:', ratings.globalRatings.Mama.rating);
console.log('Papa Global:', ratings.globalRatings.Papa.rating);
```

#### Test 2.2: Task Weight Impact
```javascript
// Test High-Weight Tasks:
- Answer question with weight 12 (bedtime routine)
- Verify larger ELO swing than weight 3 task

// Database Check:
- familyELORatings document updated
- familyELOHistory has match records
- Weight multiplier applied correctly
```

#### Test 2.3: Category Imbalances
```javascript
// Expected Categories:
const imbalances = await ELORatingService.getCategoryImbalances(familyId);

// Should show:
- "Invisible Household Tasks": Mama-heavy
- "Visible Parental Tasks": More balanced
- Confidence scores based on response count
```

---

### Phase 3: Balance Detection & Analysis
**Goal:** System identifies and quantifies imbalances

#### Test 3.1: Workload Balance Detection
```javascript
// After 30+ responses:
const detector = new WorkloadBalanceDetector();
const analysis = await detector.analyzeFamily(familyId);

// Expected Output:
{
  overallBalance: 65,  // Mama doing 65%
  categories: {
    "Invisible Household": { mama: 75, papa: 25 },
    "Visible Household": { mama: 55, papa: 45 }
  },
  severity: "moderate",
  recommendations: [...]
}
```

#### Test 3.2: Knowledge Graph Integration
```javascript
// Test Knowledge Graph Updates:
const kg = new FamilyKnowledgeGraph(familyId);
await kg.updateFromSurveyResponses();

// Verify nodes created for:
- High-impact tasks (Mama-heavy)
- Neglected responsibilities
- Time patterns
```

---

### Phase 4: AI-Powered Insights
**Goal:** Claude generates meaningful recommendations

#### Test 4.1: Dynamic Question Generation
```javascript
// Test dynamic survey questions:
const generator = new DynamicSurveyGenerator();
const questions = await generator.generatePersonalizedQuestions(
  familyId,
  memberId,
  72
);

// Verify:
- Questions reference family members by name
- Season-appropriate (winter clothing, summer activities)
- Culture-specific if location known
```

#### Test 4.2: AI Balance Insights
```javascript
// Request AI analysis:
const insights = await ClaudeService.analyzeWorkloadBalance(
  surveyResponses,
  familyData
);

// Expected insights:
- "Mama handles 80% of invisible mental load"
- "Papa could take over morning routines"
- "Consider alternating bedtime duties"
```

---

### Phase 5: Recommendations & Habits
**Goal:** System generates actionable improvements

#### Test 5.1: Task Recommendations
```javascript
const recommendations = await ELORatingService.getTaskRecommendations(familyId);

// Expected format:
[
  {
    category: "Invisible Household Tasks",
    severity: "moderate",
    suggestion: "Consider having Papa take on more invisible tasks",
    currentBalance: { Mama: 70, Papa: 30 },
    confidence: 0.85
  }
]
```

#### Test 5.2: Habit Auto-Generation
```javascript
// Test habit creation from imbalances:
const habits = await HabitGenerationService.generateFromSurvey(
  familyId,
  surveyResponses
);

// Should create habits like:
- "Papa handles morning school prep (Mon/Wed/Fri)"
- "Mama handles morning school prep (Tue/Thu)"
- "Weekly meal planning - Papa's responsibility"
```

#### Test 5.3: Task Redistribution
```javascript
// Verify tasks are reassigned:
- Morning routine → Papa (3 days/week)
- Bedtime stories → Alternating
- Weekend meal prep → Papa
- Doctor appointments → Shared calendar
```

---

### Phase 6: Progress Tracking
**Goal:** Measure improvement over time

#### Test 6.1: Weekly Check-ins
```javascript
// After 1 week with new habits:
- Weekly survey (20 questions)
- Compare ELO ratings week-over-week
- Track completion of redistributed tasks
```

#### Test 6.2: Balance Trend Analysis
```javascript
const trends = await getWeekHistoryData(familyId);

// Expected progression:
Week 1: Mama 65% / Papa 35%
Week 2: Mama 62% / Papa 38%
Week 3: Mama 58% / Papa 42%
Week 4: Mama 55% / Papa 45% ← More balanced!
```

#### Test 6.3: Family Happiness Metrics
```javascript
// Measure success indicators:
- Reduced stress levels (self-reported)
- More family time (less time on chores)
- Better communication about tasks
- Children notice more involved Papa
```

## 🔄 End-to-End Test Flow

### Complete Happy Path Test
```javascript
async function testCompleteSurveyToHappyFamily() {
  // 1. Family onboarding
  const family = await createTestFamily({
    parents: ['Mama', 'Papa'],
    children: ['Emma', 'Liam'],
    location: 'Stockholm'
  });

  // 2. Initial survey
  const responses = await simulateSurveyResponses(family.id, {
    pattern: 'mama_heavy',  // 70% Mama, 20% Papa, 10% Both
    count: 72
  });

  // 3. Verify ELO calculations
  const ratings = await ELORatingService.getFamilyRatings(family.id);
  assert(ratings.globalRatings.Mama.rating > 1600);
  assert(ratings.globalRatings.Papa.rating < 1400);

  // 4. Check balance detection
  const balance = await WorkloadBalanceDetector.analyze(family.id);
  assert(balance.severity === 'significant');

  // 5. Generate recommendations
  const recommendations = await generateRecommendations(family.id);
  assert(recommendations.length > 5);

  // 6. Create habits
  const habits = await HabitGenerationService.create(recommendations);
  assert(habits.length >= 3);

  // 7. Simulate 2 weeks of habit execution
  await simulateWeeks(2, habits);

  // 8. Weekly check-in survey
  const weeklyResponses = await simulateWeeklySurvey(family.id, {
    pattern: 'improving',  // 55% Mama, 40% Papa, 5% Both
    count: 20
  });

  // 9. Verify improvement
  const newRatings = await ELORatingService.getFamilyRatings(family.id);
  const improvement = Math.abs(
    newRatings.globalRatings.Mama.rating -
    newRatings.globalRatings.Papa.rating
  );

  assert(improvement < 100); // Much more balanced!

  // 10. Check family happiness
  const happiness = await measureFamilyHappiness(family.id);
  assert(happiness.stress < initialStress);
  assert(happiness.satisfaction > initialSatisfaction);

  return '✅ Family successfully rebalanced!';
}
