# Mapbox Location Autocomplete Fix

## Issue
The location autocomplete in the event creation form was showing duplicate suggestions for the same location (e.g., "Maplewood, Litchfield, Connecticut, United States" appearing multiple times).

## Root Causes
1. The place search functionality was disabled (`locationResults` was hardcoded to an empty array)
2. Saved locations from Firebase might contain duplicates
3. No deduplication logic for search results

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Re-enabled Place Search Hook
- Uncommented the `usePlaceSearch` hook in EventCreationForm.jsx
- Connected the location input to the Mapbox search API
- Added proper state management for search queries

### 2. Added Deduplication Logic
- Added deduplication when loading saved locations from Firebase
- Filter out search results that already exist in saved locations
- Ensure unique results based on address comparison

### 3. Improved UI/UX
- Added loading indicator while searching
- Limited search results to 5 items
- Added better formatting with map pin icons
- Added helpful messages for different states (no results, typing, etc.)
- Shows different sections for "Saved Places" vs "Search Results"

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/chat/EventCreationForm.jsx`
   - Re-enabled `usePlaceSearch` hook
   - Added deduplication logic for saved locations
   - Improved location dropdown UI
   - Added loading states and better error messages

## Testing

### 1. Test Mapbox API
Run in browser console:
```javascript
// Copy from: /public/test-mapbox-autocomplete.js
```

### 2. Check for Duplicate Saved Locations
Run in browser console:
```javascript
// Copy from: /public/check-saved-locations.js
```

If duplicates are found, run:
```javascript
removeDuplicateLocations()
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Saved Locations**: Shows deduplicated saved locations from your family's Firebase data
2. **Live Search**: When you type 3+ characters, it searches Mapbox API for matching locations
3. **No Duplicates**: Results from Mapbox that match saved locations are filtered out
4. **Better UX**: Loading indicators, helpful messages, and limited results prevent overwhelming the UI

## Next Steps

If you still see duplicates:
1. Run the `check-saved-locations.js` script to identify duplicates in Firebase
2. Use `removeDuplicateLocations()` to clean up the data
3. The autocomplete should now show unique results

The location autocomplete should now provide varied, unique suggestions without duplicates.
