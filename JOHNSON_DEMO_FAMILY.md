### 4. Knowledge Graph
**Note:** Knowledge Graph requires Neo4j data which this family doesn't have yet. Use Rodriguez family for Knowledge Graph testing.

## Script Location
```
/scripts/create-demo-family.js
```

## Re-running the Script
The script is idempotent for users (checks if email exists) but will CREATE NEW DATA each time.

**To reset:**
1. Delete Johnson family document in Firestore
2. Delete Sarah and Mike users in Firebase Auth (or skip, script will reuse)
3. Delete all associated events/tasks/documents
4. Re-run script: `node scripts/create-demo-family.js`

## Technical Details

### Firebase Configuration
- Project ID: `parentload-ba995`
- Region: `us-central1`
- Authentication: Email/Password (Firebase Auth)
- Database: Firestore
- Access Method: Firebase Admin SDK (full access)

### Service Account Key
- File: `firebase-service-account.json` (in project root)
- **SECURITY:** Added to .gitignore, never commit!
- **Purpose:** Bypasses all Firestore security rules

### Data Structure Patterns
- **Timestamps:** All use `admin.firestore.Timestamp.fromDate()` for Firestore compatibility
- **Server timestamps:** Use `admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` for creation times
- **familyId:** Always included for security rule validation
- **userId:** Required for events (Firestore query requirement)
- **Arrays:** familyMembers stored as array (not object) for FamilyContext compatibility

### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ **751 total data items** created
- ‚úÖ **1 year of data** (Oct 2024 - Oct 2025)
- ‚úÖ **5 family members** (2 parents, 3 kids)
- ‚úÖ **All major features** represented
- ‚úÖ **Realistic patterns** throughout
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** demo data
- ‚úÖ **No permission errors** (Firebase Admin SDK)

## Advantages Over Martinez Family

1. **Complete Dataset**
   - All collections created (surveys, meetings, inbox)
   - No missing pieces
   - No permission errors

2. **Clean Implementation**
   - Firebase Admin SDK = no security rule issues
   - Proper user documents from the start
   - No placeholder child IDs

3. **Better Data Quality**
   - More realistic patterns
   - Proper relationships between data
   - Clean, focused dataset (quality over quantity)

4. **Immediate Usability**
   - Login works immediately
   - All features visible
   - No console errors
   - No manual fixes needed

## Known Limitations

1. **No Neo4j Data**
   - Knowledge Graph won't show data
   - Use Rodriguez family for Knowledge Graph testing
   - Could add Neo4j data later with upload script

2. **No Google Calendar Integration**
   - All events are manual entries
   - Could add Google tokens if needed

3. **Children Don't Have Auth Accounts**
   - Children are family member objects, not Firebase users
   - This is intentional (kids typically don't login)
   - Chore assignments use child names, not UIDs

## Summary
