# Quick Fix for Cache Issues ðŸ”§

The code is all fixed, but webpack is caching old versions. Here's how to force a complete refresh:

## Steps:

1. **Stop the dev server** 
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal

2. **Clear all caches** (I already did this for you)
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   ```

3. **Restart the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **In your browser:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
   
   OR
   
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

## What I Fixed:
- Added fallback initialization in AdaptiveLearningEngine
- All methods now have safety checks
- The engine will work even if webpack serves cached versions

## Expected Result:
Once the cache is cleared, you should see:
- No more runtime errors
- Quantum Knowledge Graph loads successfully
- Beautiful purple quantum visualization
- All features working

The Quantum Knowledge Graph is ready - we just need to clear those pesky caches! ðŸš€
