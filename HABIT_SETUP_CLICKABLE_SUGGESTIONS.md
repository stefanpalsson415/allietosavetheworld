# Habit Setup - Clickable Suggestions Feature ‚úÖ

## What Was Done
Enhanced the habit setup flow in AllieChat to include clickable suggestion buttons. Now users can either click a suggestion to automatically fill their response or type their own custom answer.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Message Structure Enhancement**
Added `suggestions` array to habit setup messages:
```javascript
{
  text: "Main message text",
  suggestions: [
    { id: 'morning-coffee', text: 'After morning coffee in the kitchen', value: 'After morning coffee in the kitchen' },
    { id: 'before-bed', text: 'Before kids\' bedtime in living room', value: 'Before kids\' bedtime in living room' }
  ],
  suggestionPrompt: "When and where will you practice?",
  allowMultiple: false // optional, for multi-select
}
```

### 2. **ChatMessage Component Updates**
Added rendering for clickable suggestions:
- Displays suggestion buttons below the message text
- Blue-themed buttons with hover effects
- Shows prompt text above suggestions
- Indicates when multiple selections are allowed

### 3. **Click Handler Implementation**
Added `habit-suggestion-click` handler in `handleMessageReaction`:
- Sets the input field with the suggestion value
- Automatically sends the message after 100ms
- Preserves the conversational flow
