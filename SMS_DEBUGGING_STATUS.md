# SMS Debugging Status - Dec 3, 2025

## Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Firebase Function Deployed**: `twilioSMS` function is live and responding
2. **Webhook URL Active**: https://europe-west1-parentload-ba995.cloudfunctions.net/twilioSMS
3. **Function Can Receive SMS**: Test messages via curl are processed correctly
4. **Enhanced Logging Added**: Function now logs all request details
5. **Fallback Storage**: SMS will be saved even if family not found

### ❌ The Problem:
**Twilio is NOT calling our webhook when you send real SMS!**

## Evidence from Logs:

All requests in the logs show `user-agent: curl/8.7.1` - meaning they're our tests, not from Twilio.

When you text "+1 (719) 748-6209", Twilio is not forwarding to our function.

## Why Your SMS Still Shows in App:

The 3 SMS messages visible in your inbox (from +46731536304) are likely from:
1. Previous local development setup
2. Different webhook endpoint
3. Manual database entries

## Action Required:

### 1. Verify Twilio Webhook Settings:

Please double-check in Twilio Console:
- The webhook URL is EXACTLY: `https://europe-west1-parentload-ba995.cloudfunctions.net/twilioSMS`
- Method is: POST
- There are no typos (check for extra spaces, missing characters)
- Click "Save" again even if it looks correct

### 2. Check Twilio Activity Logs:

In Twilio Console:
1. Go to **Monitor** → **Logs** → **Messaging**
2. Find your recent SMS 
3. Check if there are any webhook errors
4. Look for the webhook URL it's trying to call

### 3. Test Twilio's Webhook Debugger:

1. In Twilio Console, go to your phone number settings
2. Use their "Test" feature if available
3. Or check **Monitor** → **Webhooks** for any failed attempts

## Possible Issues:

1. **Twilio Region Mismatch**: Your function is in `europe-west1` but Twilio might need a US endpoint
2. **Webhook Validation**: Twilio might be rejecting our response format
3. **Phone Number Configuration**: The webhook might not be saved properly
4. **Twilio Account Status**: Check if your account has any restrictions

## Quick Test:

Send another SMS now and immediately check:
```bash
firebase functions:log --only twilioSMS --lines 20
```

If you don't see your message within 10 seconds, Twilio isn't calling our webhook.

## Next Steps:

1. **Option A**: Check Twilio webhook configuration again
2. **Option B**: Try updating webhook to remove and re-add it
3. **Option C**: Check if there's a primary/fallback webhook configuration issue
4. **Option D**: Create a simpler test endpoint to verify Twilio connectivity

## Your Family Phone Issue:

Even when Twilio starts working, we need to fix phone matching:
- Your phone `+46731536304` isn't matching any family
- Check how your phone is stored in Firebase (might be just "731536304" without country code)

Let me know what you find in the Twilio logs!
