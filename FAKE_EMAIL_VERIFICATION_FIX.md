# Fake Email Verification Fix

## Problem
Users who skipped email verification during onboarding were seeing fake auto-generated emails (like "kimberly@palsson.family") displayed as "verified" in their Personal Settings.

## Root Cause
1. During signup, when a parent doesn't have a verified email, the system generates a fake email using the pattern: `${parent.name}@${familyName}.family` (UserSignupScreen.jsx:192)
2. The Personal Settings page was showing ALL emails as verified without checking if they were fake emails

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Personal Settings Email Display (UserSettingsScreen.jsx)
- Added logic to detect fake emails (those ending with `.family`)
- For fake emails, show a yellow warning box saying "Please add and confirm an email address"
- Added "Add Email" button that switches to the Account & Security tab

### 2. Added Email Verification Section in Account & Security Tab
- Created a new "Email Address" section that shows:
  - For users with fake emails: A form to add and verify a real email
  - For users with verified emails: Their email with a green checkmark
- Integrated with existing MagicLinkServiceV2 for email verification

### 3. Reused Existing Email Verification System
- The app already has a complete email verification system using magic links
- MagicLinkServiceV2 handles sending verification emails
- AuthVerificationPage handles the verification callback
- No need to create a new verification system

## How It Works Now
1. User with fake email sees "Please add and confirm an email address" in Personal Settings
2. Clicking "Add Email" takes them to Account & Security tab
3. They enter their real email and click "Send Verification Email"
4. System sends a magic link using MagicLinkServiceV2
5. User clicks the link in their email
6. AuthVerificationPage handles the verification
7. Once verified, the email shows with a green checkmark

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/user/UserSettingsScreen.jsx` - Added fake email detection and email verification UI
- No changes needed to the existing email verification infrastructure

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Log in as a user who skipped email verification during onboarding
2. Go to Settings > Personal Settings
3. Should see "Please add and confirm an email address" instead of showing the fake email as verified
4. Click "Add Email" to go to Account & Security tab
5. Enter a real email and verify it
