## Technical Implementation Details

### Common Pattern Used:
1. **Input Validation**: Check for required familyId and userId
2. **AI Extraction**: Use `ClaudeService.extractEntityWithAI()` to parse user intent
3. **Database Operations**: Direct Firestore queries and updates
4. **UI Synchronization**: Custom events dispatched for real-time updates
5. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with descriptive error messages

### Event Dispatching:
All handlers dispatch appropriate custom events to trigger UI updates:
- Calendar events trigger 'force-calendar-refresh'
- Provider changes trigger 'provider-updated' or 'provider-deleted'
- Task changes trigger 'task-completed' or 'task-reassigned'
- New items trigger specific add events

### Firebase Integration:
- Uses Firestore subcollections under families
- Implements proper timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Tracks who performed actions (createdBy, updatedBy)

## Usage Examples

Users can now say things like:
- "Update Dr. Smith's phone number to 555-1234"
- "Delete the dentist appointment"
- "Complete the grocery shopping task"
- "Reassign homework help to Dad"
- "Add Emma's vaccination record from today"
- "Record that Jake took his first steps"
- "Schedule date night for next Friday"

## Next Steps
- All handlers are now implemented and will show in the console as ✅
- The warning about unimplemented handlers will no longer appear
- Users can test all these features through the Allie chat interface
