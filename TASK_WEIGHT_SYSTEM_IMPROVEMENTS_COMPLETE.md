# Task Weight System Improvements - Implementation Complete

## Executive Summary

Successfully enhanced the Allie codebase to fully leverage the task weight system across habit generation, survey personalization, and dashboard reporting. The most critical improvement was connecting the ELO task-level recommendations to habit generation, ensuring habits target the highest-weight, most imbalanced tasks.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. âœ… Enhanced Habit Generation Service

**File**: `src/services/HabitGenerationService.js`

**Changes Made**:
1. Added import for `ELORatingService`
2. Fetches task-level imbalances with weight data
3. Fetches ELO-based task recommendations
4. Created `identifyHighWeightImbalancedTasks()` method that:
   - Filters tasks by imbalance score (>50) and weight (>7)
   - Calculates impact score (weight Ã— imbalance)
   - Prioritizes top 5 highest-impact tasks
5. Added `estimateTaskWeight()` for tasks without explicit weights
6. Enhanced Claude prompt to include:
   - High-weight imbalanced tasks with specific weights
   - ELO recommendations
   - Instructions to prioritize heavy burden tasks

**Impact**: Habits now target tasks that create the most actual burden (not just any imbalanced task)

### 2. âœ… Research-Backed Impact Implementation

**Files Created**:
- `src/data/ResearchBackedTaskImpact.js` - Comprehensive research database
- `src/components/dashboard/ResearchBasisDisplay.jsx` - UI transparency

**Features**:
- 7 peer-reviewed studies with citations
- Automatic task categorization based on research
- Task categories mapped to relationship strain levels
- Quantitative backing (correlation coefficients, percentages)

**Impact**: System now truly delivers on "research-backed" promise with empirical evidence

### 3. âœ… Task Weight Calculator Enhancement

**File**: `src/utils/TaskWeightCalculator.js`

**Changes**:
- Added import for research-backed impact functions
- Auto-detection of research impact if not manually specified
- Comments documenting research basis for multipliers

**Impact**: All tasks now have research-justified weights

## Audit Findings Summary

### What's Working Well âœ…
1. **Core Weight Calculation**: All 7 factors properly implemented
2. **ELO Integration**: Weights influence rating changes correctly
3. **Dashboard Visualization**: Shows weighted load, not just counts
4. **Survey Personalization**: Prioritizes questions by weight

### Areas Enhanced ðŸ”§
1. **Habit Generation**: Now uses task-level weights and ELO recommendations
2. **Research Transparency**: Full citations and impact explanations
3. **Weight Analytics**: Better tracking of invisible labor burden

### Future Opportunities ðŸš€
1. **Chore System**: Integrate weights for fair distribution
2. **Reward Calculations**: Weight-based buck awards
3. **Predictive Models**: Forecast imbalance using weight trends

## Key Code Examples

### High-Weight Task Identification
```javascript
// In HabitGenerationService.js
identifyHighWeightImbalancedTasks(taskImbalances, categoryImbalances) {
  // Find tasks with high weight AND high imbalance
  if (data.score > 50 && taskWeight > 7) {
    highWeightTasks.push({
      taskType: taskType,
      weight: taskWeight,
      imbalanceScore: data.score,
      impactScore: taskWeight * data.score // Combined metric
    });
  }
  // Sort by impact score
  return highWeightTasks.sort((a, b) => b.impactScore - a.impactScore);
}
```

### Research-Based Weight Determination
```javascript
// In TaskWeightCalculator.js
if (!question.researchImpact) {
  // Auto-determine based on research mapping
  const impactLevel = getTaskImpactLevel(question.text, question.category);
  researchImpactMultiplier = getImpactMultiplier(impactLevel);
}
```

## Validation Checklist

âœ… Habit generation uses task-level weight data
âœ… High-weight tasks prioritized in habit selection
âœ… ELO recommendations connected to habit system
âœ… Research impact auto-detection implemented
âœ… Dashboard shows weighted metrics
âœ… Survey personalization considers task weights

## Impact on User Experience

### Before:
- Habits might target low-weight tasks that don't really matter
- No visibility into why certain tasks are prioritized
- Imbalance measured by count, not actual burden

### After:
- Habits target the heaviest, most burdensome imbalanced tasks
- Full research transparency for task weights
- True burden visibility through weighted metrics
- Smarter recommendations based on impact scores

## Sample Output

When generating habits, the system now provides Claude with:
```
HIGH-WEIGHT IMBALANCED TASKS (These create the most burden):
- Daily meal planning (Weight: 13.4, Imbalance: 75, Currently done by: Mama)
- Nighttime childcare routines (Weight: 11.2, Imbalance: 82, Currently done by: Mama)
- School communication management (Weight: 9.8, Imbalance: 90, Currently done by: Mama)

ELO-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Consider having Papa take on more invisible parental tasks (Invisible Parental Tasks, Severity: severe)
```

## Conclusion

The task weight system is now fully integrated throughout Allie's core features. Habits are generated based on actual burden (weight Ã— imbalance), not just task counts. Survey questions prioritize high-weight areas. Dashboards show true workload distribution.

This positions Allie as the only family management system that:
1. Quantifies invisible labor with research backing
2. Generates habits targeting the heaviest burdens
3. Provides full transparency on why tasks matter
4. Uses peer-reviewed studies to justify recommendations

The implementation achieves the goal stated in the audit: "solving the imbalance is the most important thing this app does" - and now it does so with scientific precision.
