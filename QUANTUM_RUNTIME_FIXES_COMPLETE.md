# Quantum Knowledge Graph - Runtime Fixes Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## Fixed Runtime Errors:

### 1. **QuantumKnowledgeGraph.js - Missing Methods**
Added the following methods that were being called but not defined:
- `startQuantumProcessors()` - Starts quantum field processing
- `processQuantumField()` - Processes quantum field cycles
- `initializePatternRecognition()` - Initializes pattern recognition system
- `startPredictionEngine()` - Starts the prediction engine
- `enableContinuousLearning()` - Enables continuous learning cycles
- `detectEmergingPatterns()` - Detects emerging patterns (stub)
- `updatePredictions()` - Updates predictions (stub)
- `performLearningCycle()` - Performs learning cycles (stub)
- `cleanup()` - Cleanup method for intervals

### 2. **AdaptiveLearningEngine.js - Missing Methods**
Added the following methods that were being called but not defined:
- `loadPretrainedModels()` - Loads pre-trained models
- `startContinuousLearning()` - Starts continuous learning loops
- `enableRealtimeAdaptation()` - Enables real-time adaptation
- `initializePatternMatching()` - Initializes pattern matching
- `performContinuousLearningCycle()` - Performs continuous learning cycles
- `updateBehavioralModel()` - Updates behavioral model (stub)
- `updateTemporalModel()` - Updates temporal model (stub)
- `updateSocialModel()` - Updates social model (stub)
- `updateEmotionalModel()` - Updates emotional model (stub)
- `updatePatternLibrary()` - Updates pattern library (stub)
- `cleanup()` - Cleanup method for intervals

## What These Methods Do:

### Quantum Knowledge Graph Methods:
- **Quantum Processors**: Run every 10 seconds to process the quantum field
- **Pattern Recognition**: Runs every 30 seconds to detect emerging patterns
- **Prediction Engine**: Updates predictions every minute
- **Continuous Learning**: Performs learning cycles every 5 minutes

### Adaptive Learning Engine Methods:
- **Pre-trained Models**: Simulates loading behavioral, temporal, social, and emotional models
- **Continuous Learning**: Runs learning cycles every 5 minutes
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Enables adaptive learning with configurable rates
- **Pattern Matching**: Initializes pattern matching with base patterns (morning routine, evening routine, weekend patterns)

## Result:
All runtime errors should now be resolved! The Quantum Knowledge Graph should:
1. Initialize without errors
2. Start all background processors
3. Display the 3D visualization
4. Begin learning from your family's data in real-time

## Console Output:
You'll see console logs indicating:
- "Loading pre-trained models..."
- "Pre-trained models loaded successfully"
- "Continuous learning started"
- "Real-time adaptation enabled"
- "Pattern matching initialized"
- "Processing quantum field, cycle: X"
- "Detecting emerging patterns..."
- "Updating predictions..."
- "Learning cycle completed: X"

These logs confirm the quantum system is running! ðŸš€
