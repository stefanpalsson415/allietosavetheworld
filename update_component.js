// Steps to update the components:

// 1. Default event type to 'general'
// - The conditional in the className for the General button is already doing this: (!event.category || event.category === 'general')
// - We added a useEffect that sets default values if both eventType and category are not set

// 2. Date format to show "May 23, 2025"
// - The date format is already using 'month: long' in the toLocaleDateString call

// 3. Time input to only allow 15 minute intervals
// - Added step="900" to the time input
// - Added code to round the selected minutes to the nearest 15-minute interval

// All of these changes should now be in the file, but there may be syntax issues.
// The most likely culprit is a syntax error in a JSX comment or something else.

// To fix:
// 1. Make sure all JSX comments use the {/* */} syntax
// 2. Make sure there are no JavaScript-style comments in the attribute values
// 3. Ensure all JSX elements are properly closed

// If it still doesn't work, try rebuilding the time input section completely:
