# Memory-Graph Attachments Implementation

## Overview
We've successfully implemented the Memory-Graph Attachments feature as shown in the screenshot. This feature allows users to drag and drop documents (emails, PDFs, photos) which are then:
1. OCR'd to extract text content
2. Automatically categorized
3. Added to the Family Knowledge Graph
4. Linked to related entities (people, events, tasks, providers)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced DocumentProcessingService
- Added `addToKnowledgeGraph()` method that:
  - Creates document entities in the knowledge graph
  - Extracts and links to mentioned people
  - Creates event entities from future dates found in documents
  - Extracts provider information from medical documents
  - Creates task entities from action items
- Enhanced `extractEntities()` to detect action items using patterns like:
  - "need to", "must", "should", "please"
  - "action item:", "todo:", "task:"
  - Checkboxes and bullet points
  - Numbered lists

### 2. Knowledge Graph Integration
Documents are now automatically:
- Added as entities with type 'document'
- Linked to family members mentioned in the content
- Connected to events extracted from dates
- Associated with providers found in medical documents
- Connected to tasks created from action items

### 3. UI Components
Added a new "Documents" tab to the Knowledge Graph viewer that includes:
- Clear instructions on how the feature works
- DocumentUploadZone for drag-and-drop functionality
- Display of recent documents in the knowledge graph
- Click-to-view details for each document

### 4. Allie Chat Integration
Enhanced Allie to understand document queries:
- Detects phrases like "show me docs", "documents tied to", "homework board"
- Provides context about documents in the knowledge graph
- Can answer questions about specific documents and their relationships

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. Navigate to the Knowledge Graph tab
2. Click on the "Documents" tab
3. Drag any email PDF, photo, or document onto the upload area
4. The document will be:
   - Uploaded and OCR'd
   - Categorized (medical, school, financial, etc.)
   - Added to the knowledge graph with relationships
5. Ask Allie questions like:
   - "Show me docs tied to Tegner's homework board"
   - "Find documents related to medical appointments"
   - "What documents mention [child's name]?"

### For Developers:
The document flow is:
1. `DocumentUploadZone` → handles drag-drop UI
2. `DocumentProcessingService.processDocument()` → OCR and extraction
3. `DocumentProcessingService.addToKnowledgeGraph()` → graph integration
4. `FamilyKnowledgeGraph` → stores entities and relationships
5. `AllieChat` → queries the graph for document information

## Example Relationships Created

When a school permission slip is uploaded:
```
Document Entity: "Field Trip Permission Slip"
  ↓
Creates Event: "Field Trip on March 15"
  ↓
Links to Child: "Tegner"
  ↓
Creates Task: "Return signed permission slip by March 10"
```

When a medical document is uploaded:
```
Document Entity: "Pediatric Visit Summary"
  ↓
Links to Child: "Emma"
  ↓
Creates Provider: "Dr. Smith - Pediatrics"
  ↓
Creates Event: "Follow-up appointment April 1"
  ↓
Creates Task: "Schedule vaccine appointment"
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Better provider name extraction using NLP
2. Smart document deduplication
3. Document versioning support
4. Integration with calendar for extracted events
5. Automatic task assignment based on document content
