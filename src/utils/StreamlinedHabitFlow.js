// Atomic Habits Framework - 4 Laws for Building Good Habits (or Breaking Bad Ones)

**Framework for Building Good Habits (or Breaking Bad Ones):**

**1. Make it Obvious (Cue)**
Design your environment so the habit is impossible to miss. Put your gym clothes out the night before. Place your vitamins next to your coffee maker. The idea is to create clear visual cues that trigger the behavior automatically.

**2. Make it Attractive (Craving)**
Bundle the habit with something you enjoy or join a culture where the behavior is normal. Listen to your favorite podcast only while exercising. Find a study group if you want to read more. You need to actually want to do the habit.

**3. Make it Easy (Response)**
Reduce friction and start incredibly small. Don't commit to reading a book - commit to reading one page. Don't plan a 1-hour workout - start with 2 minutes. The easier it is to start, the more likely you'll actually do it.

**4. Make it Satisfying (Reward)**
Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete the habit. Check off the habit in a tracker. Give yourself a small celebration. Put a dollar in a jar for something you want. The key is making the completion feel good right away, not just eventually.

_To break bad habits, simply reverse these: Make it Invisible (remove cues), Make it Unattractive (reframe your mindset), Make it Difficult (add friction), and Make it Unsatisfying (add immediate consequences)._

**Law #2: Make it Attractive**

How will you make "${habitContext.title}" something you actually WANT to do?

**Law #3: Make it Easy**

Start incredibly small. The easier it is to start, the more likely you'll actually do it.

What's the absolute smallest version of "${habitContext.title}" you can do?

Examples:
‚Ä¢ Don't plan to read a book ‚Üí Read 1 page
‚Ä¢ Don't commit to 1-hour workout ‚Üí Do 2 minutes

**Law #4: Make it Satisfying**

Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete the habit. The key is making it feel good RIGHT NOW, not eventually.

**Final Step: Your Identity** üí™

Complete this sentence: "I am someone who..."

This connects the habit to who you're becoming! Research shows that identity-based habits are more likely to stick.

‚Ä¢ "I am someone who prioritizes my health"
‚Ä¢ "I am someone who shows up for my family"
