## 🎯 What We Found

**ZERO complete users** in your Firebase.

**Issue**: Users have Auth credentials but no Firestore metadata or family connections.

**Audit Results**:
```
✗ 7 Firebase Auth users
✗ 6 Firestore users (4 without familyId, 2 orphaned)
✗ 12 Families (8 orphaned, 4 incomplete)
✗ 0 Complete users (Auth + Firestore + Family)
```

## 🚀 Fix It (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Delete All Incomplete Data
```bash
node cleanup-user-data.js
```
Type: `DELETE ALL` when prompted

### Step 2: Deploy Leads System Rules

firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Step 3: Test New User
1. Go to https://checkallie.com/onboarding

3. Create password (NEW feature Oct 10)
4. Use coupon code
5. Verify dashboard loads ✅

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will I lose data?**
A: Yes - that's the point. Fresh start with clean data.

**Q: Do I need to backup?**
A: Your current data is incomplete/test data. But if you want, the audit JSON has everything.

**Q: What if new user creation fails?**
A: Check `PaymentScreen.jsx:102` and `DatabaseService.js:1390` - those create users/families.

**Q: What's the leads system for?**
A: Blog subscribers and quiz emails - separate from full user accounts.

## 🚨 Important

- `cleanup-user-data.js` is **IRREVERSIBLE**
- Requires typing "DELETE ALL" to proceed
- `serviceAccountKey.json` is in `.gitignore` (never commit)
- Test new user creation AFTER cleanup

**Ready?** Run `node cleanup-user-data.js` to start fresh! 🚀
