# Quantum Knowledge Graph Performance Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **Auto-initialization on Import**: The QuantumKnowledgeGraph service was exported as a singleton (`new QuantumKnowledgeGraph()`) which automatically started 8 different interval timers immediately on import.

2. **Multiple High-Frequency Intervals**:
   - Quantum processor: Every 10 seconds
   - Pattern recognition: Every 30 seconds
   - UI real-time updates: Every 30 seconds
   - Plus 5 more intervals running constantly

3. **No Cleanup**: Intervals were never being cleaned up, causing memory leaks and CPU usage.

4. **Event Loop Guard Triggering**: The constant processing was triggering the event loop guard circuit breakers.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Disabled Auto-initialization
- Commented out `this.initializeQuantumField()` in the constructor
- Added flags `processorsEnabled` and `isInitialized` to control when processors run

### 2. Added Enable/Disable Control
- New method `setProcessorsEnabled(enabled)` to turn processors on/off
- Enhanced `cleanup()` method to properly clear all intervals

### 3. Created Configuration System
- New file `src/config/quantumConfig.js` with:
  - Global enable/disable switch (currently `false`)
  - Reduced interval frequencies
  - Default real-time mode set to `false`

### 4. Updated Interval Timings
- Quantum field: 10s → 30s
- Pattern recognition: 30s → 60s
- Predictions: 60s → 5 minutes
- Learning: 5 minutes → 10 minutes
- UI updates: 30s → 60s

### 5. Fixed UI Component
- QuantumKnowledgeGraphUIFixed now starts with real-time mode OFF
- Uses configuration for update intervals

## How to Use

### Temporary Disable (Browser Console)
```javascript
// Run the disable script
await fetch('/disable-quantum-processors.js').then(r => r.text()).then(eval);
```

### Permanent Control (In Code)
```javascript
// To enable quantum processors after surveys complete
import QuantumKnowledgeGraph from './services/QuantumKnowledgeGraph';
QuantumKnowledgeGraph.setProcessorsEnabled(true);

// To disable
QuantumKnowledgeGraph.setProcessorsEnabled(false);
```

### Configuration
Edit `src/config/quantumConfig.js` to:
- Enable/disable globally
- Adjust interval timings
- Set conditions for auto-enabling

## Next Steps

1. **Survey Integration**: Add logic to enable quantum processors only after user completes initial surveys
2. **User Settings**: Add UI toggle for users to enable/disable quantum features
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics to track quantum processor impact
4. **Lazy Loading**: Consider loading quantum features only when needed

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:
1. Check browser console - you should NOT see "Processing quantum field" messages
2. Check event loop guard status - should show no circuit breaker activations
3. Monitor browser performance - CPU usage should be normal
4. Real-time mode in quantum UI should default to OFF
