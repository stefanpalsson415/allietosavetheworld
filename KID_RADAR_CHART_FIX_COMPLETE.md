# Kids Radar Chart Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Member Count Issue
**Problem**: Showing "2 children" instead of 3
**Fix**: Updated the member count logic to properly count all children in the family:
```javascript
const childMembers = familyMembers.filter(m => m.role === 'child').length;
return childMembers || surveyData.aggregatedData.childMemberCount || 0;
```

### 2. Radar Chart Not Showing
**Problem**: When kids had no responses for certain categories, the chart values were set to 0, making the chart invisible
**Fix**: Changed the default value from 0 to 50 when no responses exist for a category, ensuring the chart is always visible

### 3. Response Count
The 172 responses shown is correct and comes from the aggregated data.

## What the Fix Does

1. **Correct Child Count**: Now properly counts all children in the family (should show 3 kids)
2. **Visible Chart**: Even when kids haven't responded to all categories, the chart will show with default values
3. **Accurate Response Tracking**: Maintains the correct response count from aggregated data

## Expected Result

The Kids view should now show:
- "Based on the Four Categories framework â€¢ 172 responses from 3 children"
- A visible radar chart showing the balance between mama and papa based on kids' responses
- If no kids have responded to certain categories, those will show as balanced (50/50)

## Note
The fixes ensure that the kids' perspective is always visible in the radar chart, even if they haven't answered all questions yet.
