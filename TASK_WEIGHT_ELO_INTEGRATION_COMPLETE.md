# Task Weight and ELO Integration - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully integrated task weights into the ELO rating system. Task weights now directly influence ELO rating changes, with heavier tasks (frequent, invisible, emotionally demanding) creating proportionally larger rating swings.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core ELO Calculation Enhancement
**File: `src/services/ELORatingService.js`**

- Modified `calculateELO()` method to accept a `taskWeight` parameter
- Implemented weight multiplier calculation (capped between 0.4x and 2.5x)
- Applied weight multiplier to K-factor for dynamic rating adjustments
- Added weight impact logging for debugging

```javascript
// Weight multiplier calculation
const AVERAGE_WEIGHT = 5; // Approximate average task weight
const weightMultiplier = Math.min(2.5, Math.max(0.4, taskWeight / AVERAGE_WEIGHT));

// Apply to K-factor
const kFactorA = this.K_FACTOR * (uncertaintyA / 100) * weightMultiplier;
const kFactorB = this.K_FACTOR * (uncertaintyB / 100) * weightMultiplier;
```

### 2. Match History Enhancement
**File: `src/services/ELORatingService.js`**

- Updated match history storage to include:
  - Task weight value
  - Weight multiplier applied
  - Impact score (rating change × task weight)
  - Proper rating changes tracking

### 3. New Analytics Methods
**File: `src/services/ELORatingService.js`**

Added two new methods:
- `getRecentMatchHistory()` - Retrieves recent matches with weight data
- `getWeightStatistics()` - Calculates weight-based statistics:
  - Average task weight
  - Weight distribution
  - High-weight task wins per parent
  - Total weighted load per parent

### 4. UI Enhancements
**File: `src/components/dashboard/ELORatingsDisplay.jsx`**

Added new "Task Weight Impact" section showing:
- Weighted load totals for each parent
- Count of heavy tasks (weight > 7) handled
- Recent high-impact changes with weight indicators
- Visual indicators for weight influence (↑ for amplified changes)

### 5. Context Integration
**File: `src/contexts/FamilyContext.js`**

Exposed new methods:
- `getRecentMatchHistory()`
- `getWeightStatistics()`

## How It Works

1. **Survey Response**: When a user answers a survey question, the task weight is extracted from `questionData.totalWeight`

2. **ELO Calculation**: The weight multiplier adjusts the K-factor:
   - Weight 2.5 (light task) → 0.5x multiplier → smaller rating changes
   - Weight 5 (average task) → 1.0x multiplier → normal rating changes
   - Weight 10 (heavy task) → 2.0x multiplier → larger rating changes

3. **Visual Feedback**: Users can see:
   - Total weighted load distribution
   - Which parent handles more heavy tasks
   - How task weight affected recent ELO changes

## Impact Metrics

- **Immediate**: High-weight tasks now create 2-2.5x larger ELO swings
- **Visible**: Weight influence shown in UI with impact indicators
- **Accurate**: Better reflection of actual workload distribution
- **Fair**: Invisible/emotional labor properly weighted in balance calculations

## Technical Details

### Weight Ranges
- Minimum task weight: ~1.9 (light, visible, quarterly tasks)
- Average task weight: ~5.0 (typical household tasks)
- Maximum task weight: ~14.2 (heavy, invisible, multiple daily with high impact)

### Multiplier Caps
- Minimum multiplier: 0.4x (prevents tasks from being too insignificant)
- Maximum multiplier: 2.5x (prevents extreme rating swings)

### Database Changes
- Match history now stores `weightMultiplier` and `impactScore`
- No migration needed - existing data continues to work

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Track weight trends over time
   - Identify patterns in heavy task distribution
   - Generate weight-based recommendations

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Add weight badges to individual tasks
   - Show weight breakdown by category
   - Create weight-based task suggestions

3. **Fine-tuning**
   - Adjust multiplier caps based on user feedback
   - Consider category-specific weight adjustments
   - Add seasonal weight variations

## Verification

To verify the implementation is working:

1. Answer survey questions and observe larger ELO changes for high-weight tasks
2. Check the "Task Weight Impact" section in the ELO display
3. Review recent matches to see weight multipliers in action
4. Compare weighted load totals to identify imbalances

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
