## What Needs to Be Done Next

### HIGH PRIORITY (Connect Existing Services)
These services are built and just need to be wired up:

1. **Connect InvisibleLoadForensicsService**
   ```javascript
   // In AllieChatHooks.jsx line 362
   import InvisibleLoadForensicsService from '../../../services/forensics/InvisibleLoadForensicsService';

   const loadForensicsData = useCallback(async () => {
     const data = await InvisibleLoadForensicsService.analyzeFamily(familyId);
     setForensicsData(data);
     return data;
   }, [familyId]);
   ```

2. **Connect ForensicsToHabitsService**
   ```javascript
   // In AllieChatHooks.jsx line 399
   import ForensicsToHabitsService from '../../../services/ForensicsToHabitsService';

   const generateRecommendations = useCallback(async (forensics, selectedUser, familyMembers) => {
     const habits = await ForensicsToHabitsService.recommendHabits(
       forensics,
       { currentUser: selectedUser, familyMembers }
     );
     setRecommendations(habits);
     return habits;
   }, []);
   ```

3. **Verify NeutralVoiceService Integration**
   ```javascript
   // Check AllieConversationEngine.jsx
   // Should already be using NeutralVoiceService
   // Just verify it's working correctly
   ```

4. **Check PowerFeaturesTab Accessibility**
   - Verify it's in the dashboard tabs
   - Test navigation to Power Features
   - Ensure forensics data displays

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Build Missing UI)

5. **Perception Gap Visualizer**
   - Visual component showing 87% vs 43% discrepancy
   - Animated bar chart or similar
   - **Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

6. **"Aha Moment" Presentation Flow**
   - Dramatic reveal of imbalance data
   - Step-by-step narrative
   - **Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

7. **Automatic Weekly Measurement**
   - Background job to measure balance weekly
   - Store historical data
   - **Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

---

### LOWER PRIORITY (New Features)

8. **Child Visibility Features** (Week 5-6 Roadmap)
   - KidDashboard component
   - Family meeting templates
   - Feedback prompts
   - Transparency mode
   - **Estimated Time**: 2-3 weeks

## Testing Checklist

When services are connected, test:
- [ ] Ask "Is our workload balanced?" in AllieChat
- [ ] Verify InvisibleLoadForensicsService loads data
- [ ] Check NeutralVoiceService filters response
- [ ] Verify habit recommendations generated
- [ ] Test ForensicsToHabitsService pipeline
- [ ] Check celebration modal triggers after habit completion

**Status**: üü° **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**
- Architecture: ‚úÖ 100%
- Infrastructure: ‚úÖ 100%
- Service Integration: ‚ö†Ô∏è 20% (services exist, not connected)
- UI Components: ‚ùå 40% (some exist, need more)

**Next Action**: Connect existing services (2-3 hours to complete Week 1-2 foundation)
