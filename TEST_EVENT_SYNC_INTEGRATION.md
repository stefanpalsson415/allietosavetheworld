# Event Sync Integration Test Results

## Summary
Successfully implemented global event synchronization between the home screen upcoming events and Allie chat.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated NotionUpcomingEvents.jsx
- Changed from `NewEventContext` to `UnifiedEventContext` for global event management
- Modified `handleEventClick` to pass complete event data including:
  - Title with emojis preserved
  - Correct time from event data
  - All attendees
  - Location and other metadata
- Added proper event data transformation to ensure all fields are included

### 2. Updated AllieChat.jsx
- Modified the `event-form-submit` handler to support both create and update operations
- Added check for `eventData.editMode` to determine whether to create or update
- Used `unifiedEventContext.updateEvent()` for edits instead of `CalendarService.addEvent()`
- Added support for event deletion when delete flag is set
- Updated success/error messages to reflect whether it's a create or update operation

## How It Works Now

1. **Clicking an event in the home screen:**
   - NotionUpcomingEvents creates a detailed prompt with all event information
   - Passes the complete event object with all fields preserved
   - Opens Allie chat with `eventEdit: true` flag

2. **Allie chat receives the event:**
   - Detects it's an edit request from the prompt
   - Creates an event form message with `editMode: true`
   - Passes the existing event data to EventCreationForm

3. **User edits and saves:**
   - EventCreationForm submits with `editMode: true` and event ID
   - AllieChat handler uses `unifiedEventContext.updateEvent()` to save globally
   - Calendar is refreshed to show updated event

4. **Event deletion:**
   - Delete button in EventCreationForm sends delete flag
   - AllieChat handler uses `unifiedEventContext.deleteEvent()`
   - Event is removed from global state

## Test Scenarios

1. âœ… Click event "ðŸ¦· Dentist" - Title with emoji should appear correctly
2. âœ… Event time should match what's shown in home screen (10:00 AM, not 5:00 PM)
3. âœ… Attendees should be preserved and shown in the form
4. âœ… Edits made in Allie chat should reflect globally in calendar
5. âœ… Deleting an event should remove it from calendar

## Key Benefits

- Events are now truly global - changes in one place reflect everywhere
- No more data loss when passing events between components
- Consistent event handling across the application
- Proper support for event updates, not just creation
