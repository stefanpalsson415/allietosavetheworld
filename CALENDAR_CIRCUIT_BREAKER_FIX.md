# Calendar Circuit Breaker Fix - Summary

## Issue:
Users were seeing an orange notification "Calendar event loading is temporarily disabled due to excessive requests" when creating a new family or logging in, even though they hadn't touched the calendar yet.

## Root Cause:
The calendar circuit breaker state was persisting across sessions and not being reset when:
1. A new family was created
2. A user logged in
3. A family was loaded

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Reset on Family Creation (UserSignupScreen.jsx)
Added circuit breaker reset after successful family creation:
```javascript
// Reset calendar circuit breaker for new family
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window._resetCalendarCircuitBreaker) {
  console.log("Resetting calendar circuit breaker for new family");
  window._resetCalendarCircuitBreaker();
}
```

### 2. Reset on Family Load (AuthContext.js)
Added reset when loading family data:
```javascript
// Reset calendar circuit breaker when loading a family
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window._resetCalendarCircuitBreaker) {
  console.log("Resetting calendar circuit breaker for family load");
  window._resetCalendarCircuitBreaker();
}
```

### 3. Reset on User Login (AuthContext.js)
Added reset when authentication state changes to logged in:
```javascript
// Reset calendar circuit breaker on login
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window._resetCalendarCircuitBreaker) {
  console.log("Resetting calendar circuit breaker on login");
  window._resetCalendarCircuitBreaker();
}
```

## How It Works Now:
1. When a new family is created, the circuit breaker is automatically reset
2. When a user logs in, the circuit breaker is reset
3. When switching between families, the circuit breaker is reset
4. This ensures users don't see false warnings about calendar loading being disabled

## Manual Reset (if needed):
Users can also manually reset the circuit breaker by:
1. Opening browser console (F12)
2. Running: `window._resetCalendarCircuitBreaker()`

## Prevention:
The circuit breaker will still activate if there are genuine infinite loops or excessive requests, but it won't carry over between sessions or families.
