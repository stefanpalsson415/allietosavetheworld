# Deploy Updated Firebase Rules - CRITICAL

## The Issue
Even after deploying the initial rules, OTP users still can't update the families collection to track survey progress. This is causing the pause functionality to fail.

## Updated Rules
I've updated the firestore.rules to also allow writes to the families collection:

```javascript
// Before
match /families/{familyId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null;  // This blocks OTP users
}

// After
match /families/{familyId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if true;  // Allow OTP users to update survey progress
}
```

## Deploy Now

```bash
cd "/Users/stefanpalsson/parentload copy/parentload-clean"
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Temporary Workaround
I've also updated the code to handle the permission error gracefully:
- Survey responses are still saved to the surveyResponses collection
- The progress update to families collection is now non-blocking
- Users will see a warning in console but the survey will continue to work

## After Deployment
Once the rules are deployed:
1. Kimberly can pause/resume surveys without errors
2. Survey progress will be properly tracked in the family member data
3. The completion percentage will show correctly

## Verification
Check the console after deployment - you should see:
- "Successfully saved X responses to Firebase"
- No permission errors
