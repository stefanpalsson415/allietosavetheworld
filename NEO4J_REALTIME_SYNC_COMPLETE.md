# Real-Time Neo4j Sync - Production Complete ✅

## Overview
Built production-scale **real-time Firestore → Neo4j synchronization** using Cloud Functions. Every time a family uses Allie, their data automatically flows into the Knowledge Graph.

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**
**Deployment:** Cloud Functions (us-central1)

## What Was Built

### 5 Cloud Function Triggers (Auto-sync)

| Trigger | Fires On | Syncs To Neo4j |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| `syncFamilyToNeo4j` | `families/{familyId}` changes | Person nodes + PARENT_OF/MEMBER_OF relationships |
| `syncTaskToNeo4j` | `kanbanTasks/{taskId}` changes | Task nodes + CREATED_BY relationships |
| `syncEventToNeo4j` | `events/{eventId}` changes | Event nodes + ORGANIZES relationships |
| `syncChoreToNeo4j` | `choreInstances/{choreId}` created | Cognitive load updates for parents/children |
| `syncFairPlayToNeo4j` | `fairPlayResponses/{responseId}` created | Responsibility nodes + OWNS relationships |

### How It Works

```
User creates task in Allie
    ↓
Firestore: kanbanTasks/{taskId} written
    ↓
Cloud Function: syncTaskToNeo4j triggers automatically
    ↓
Transform Firestore doc → Cypher query
    ↓
Neo4j: CREATE (t:Task)-[:CREATED_BY]→(p:Person)
    ↓
Knowledge Graph updates in real-time
    ↓
User sees new data in Knowledge Graph tab
```

**Zero manual intervention needed!**

## Production Architecture

### Files Created

**Cloud Functions:**
- `/functions/neo4j-sync.js` (484 lines) - Core sync service
  - Neo4j connection with retry logic
  - Transform functions for each data type
  - Cognitive load calculation algorithms
  - Error handling and exponential backoff

**Triggers (in `/functions/index.js`):**
```javascript
exports.syncFamilyToNeo4j = functions.firestore
  .document('families/{familyId}')
  .onWrite(neo4jSyncModule.onFamilyWrite);

exports.syncTaskToNeo4j = functions.firestore
  .document('kanbanTasks/{taskId}')
  .onWrite(neo4jSyncModule.onTaskWrite);

exports.syncEventToNeo4j = functions.firestore
  .document('events/{eventId}')
  .onWrite(neo4jSyncModule.onEventWrite);

exports.syncChoreToNeo4j = functions.firestore
  .document('choreInstances/{choreId}')
  .onCreate(neo4jSyncModule.onChoreCreate);

exports.syncFairPlayToNeo4j = functions.firestore
  .document('fairPlayResponses/{responseId}')
  .onCreate(neo4jSyncModule.onFairPlayResponseCreate);
```

**Utility Scripts:**
- `/scripts/trigger-johnson-sync.js` - Manually trigger family sync
- `/scripts/backfill-johnson-neo4j.js` - Backfill existing data

### Dependencies Added

**functions/package.json:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "neo4j-driver": "^5.28.2"
  }
}
```

### Firebase Config

## Data Flow Examples

### Family Sync
```cypher
// When family created/updated in Firestore
MERGE (p:Person {userId: $userId})
SET p.name = $name,
    p.role = $role,
    p.isParent = $isParent,
    p.familyId = $familyId

MERGE (f:Family {familyId: $familyId})
SET f.name = $familyName
MERGE (p)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(f)

// Connect parent relationships
FOREACH (_ IN CASE WHEN p.isParent = true THEN [1] ELSE [] END |
  MERGE (c:Person {userId: child.userId})
  MERGE (p)-[:PARENT_OF]->(c)
)
```

### Task Sync
```cypher
// When task created/updated in Firestore
MERGE (t:Task {taskId: $taskId})
SET t.title = $title,
    t.category = $category,
    t.priority = $priority,
    t.cognitiveLoad = $cognitiveLoad

OPTIONAL MATCH (p:Person {userId: $assignee})
FOREACH (_ IN CASE WHEN p IS NOT NULL THEN [1] ELSE [] END |
  MERGE (p)-[:CREATED]->(t)
)
```

### Cognitive Load Calculation
```javascript
calculateTaskCognitiveLoad(taskData) {
  let load = 0.0;

  // Priority weight
  const priorityWeight = { low: 0.1, medium: 0.2, high: 0.3 };
  load += priorityWeight[taskData.priority] || 0.2;

  // Category weight (admin tasks = high load)
  const categoryWeight = {
    admin: 0.3,
    health: 0.25,
    school: 0.25,
    family: 0.15,
    home: 0.1
  };
  load += categoryWeight[taskData.category] || 0.15;

  // Description complexity
  const descLength = (taskData.description || '').length;
  if (descLength > 200) load += 0.2;
  else if (descLength > 100) load += 0.1;

  return Math.min(load, 1.0);
}
```

## Test Results - Johnson Family

### Backfill Summary
```
✅ Tasks synced: 200
✅ Events synced: 338
✅ Chores synced: 100
✅ Fair Play synced: 0
📦 Total: 638 items
```

### Neo4j Verification
```
Event: 338 nodes
Task: 200 nodes
Person: 5 nodes
Family: 1 node
```

**All data synced successfully!** ✅

## How to Use

### For New Families
**Automatic** - No action needed!
1. Family signs up for Allie
2. Creates events, tasks, chores, etc.
3. Data automatically syncs to Neo4j in real-time
4. Knowledge Graph instantly shows their data

### For Existing Families (Backfill)
If a family already has data in Firestore, backfill it:

```bash
# 1. Create backfill script for specific family
# Edit scripts/backfill-johnson-neo4j.js
# Change FAMILY_ID to target family

# 2. Run backfill
node scripts/backfill-johnson-neo4j.js

# This updates all existing documents, triggering sync functions
```

### Test with Johnson Family
```bash
# Login at https://checkallie.com
Email: sarah@johnson-demo.family
Password: DemoFamily2024!

# Navigate to: Dashboard → Knowledge Graph tab
# You'll see:
- 5 Person nodes (2 parents, 3 children)
- 200 Task nodes
- 338 Event nodes
- Relationships connecting everything
```

## Error Handling

### Retry Logic
```javascript
async executeWrite(cypher, params = {}, retries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const result = await session.run(cypher, params);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt < retries) {
        // Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s
        await new Promise(resolve =>
          setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000)
        );
      }
    }
  }
  throw lastError;
}
```

### Graceful Failures
- **Neo4j unavailable**: Function logs error but doesn't fail Firestore operation
- **Person not found**: Uses `OPTIONAL MATCH` + `FOREACH` pattern to skip relationship creation
- **Network timeout**: 3 retries with exponential backoff
- **Invalid data**: Logs warning, continues processing

---

## Monitoring

### Cloud Functions Logs
```bash
# View recent logs
firebase functions:log

# Check specific function
firebase functions:log | grep syncTaskToNeo4j
```

### Firebase Console
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/parentload-ba995/functions/logs

Look for:
- ✅ `Neo4j connected for sync`
- ✅ `Neo4j write successful`
- ✅ `Synced task: [task title]`
- ❌ `Task sync error:` (investigate failures)

### Neo4j Browser
https://console.neo4j.io/

Run verification queries:
```cypher
// Count all synced families
MATCH (f:Family)
RETURN f.familyId, f.name

// Check specific family data
MATCH (n {familyId: 'johnson_demo_family'})
RETURN labels(n)[0] AS type, count(n) AS count

// View family graph
MATCH (p:Person)-[r]->(n)
WHERE p.familyId = 'johnson_demo_family'
RETURN p, r, n
LIMIT 100
```

## Performance

### Scalability
- **Connection pooling**: 10 connections max (Cloud Functions limit)
- **Batch operations**: Firestore batch writes trigger functions efficiently
- **Async execution**: Each trigger runs independently
- **Regional deployment**: us-central1 (same as Firestore)

### Costs
- **Cloud Functions**: $0.40 per million invocations
  - Free tier: 2 million invocations/month
- **Neo4j Aura**: Free tier (single instance)
  - 200k nodes, 400k relationships
- **Expected**: Minimal cost for typical family usage

### Typical Family (100 users/month)
- 500 events created → 500 function invocations
- 300 tasks created → 300 function invocations
- 200 chores completed → 200 function invocations
- **Total**: ~1,000 invocations/month (well under free tier)

---

## Known Limitations

### Collections Not Synced (Yet)
- `documents` - Could add later if needed
- `weeklyCheckIns` - Survey data (low priority for graph)
- `familyMeetings` - Meeting notes (low priority for graph)
- `inboxMessages` - Email/SMS (not graph-worthy)

**Why:** These don't contribute significantly to family relationship insights.

### Firestore → Neo4j Only
- **One-way sync**: Firestore is source of truth
- **No Neo4j → Firestore**: Graph is read-only from user perspective
- **Rationale**: App writes to Firestore, reads from both

### Delete Operations
Tasks and Events: Supported via `onWrite` (detects deletes)
Chores and Fair Play: Not supported (use `onCreate` only)

**Reason:** Chores affect cognitive load cumulatively - deleting one shouldn't reduce load retroactively.

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate (Next Steps)
1. ✅ **Add to CLAUDE.md** - Document for future reference
2. **Create Martinez backfill** - Sync existing Martinez family
3. **Add to production deployment** - Update deployment docs

### Medium-term
1. **Document sync** - Add `documents/{docId}` trigger
2. **Fair Play backfill** - Sync existing Fair Play responses
3. **Bulk delete handling** - Clean up Neo4j when families delete data
4. **Relationship weights** - Calculate relationship strength based on interaction frequency

### Long-term
1. **Graph analytics** - Pre-compute centrality, clustering, community detection
2. **Temporal graphs** - Add time-based edges for pattern analysis
3. **Predictive modeling** - Use graph structure to predict burnout, conflicts
4. **Multi-family anonymized insights** - Aggregate patterns across families (privacy-preserving)
