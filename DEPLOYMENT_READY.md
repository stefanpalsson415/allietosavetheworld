## Quick Start (When Docker is Ready)

```bash
# 1. Start Neo4j
cd /Users/stefanpalsson/parentload\ copy/parentload-clean/neo4j
docker compose up -d

# 2. Wait 30 seconds for Neo4j to start, then load schemas
docker exec -i allie-neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p parentload_secure_2025 < schemas/01-indexes.cypher
docker exec -i allie-neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p parentload_secure_2025 < schemas/02-constraints.cypher
docker exec -i allie-neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p parentload_secure_2025 < schemas/03-fair-play-cards.cypher
docker exec -i allie-neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p parentload_secure_2025 < schemas/04-relationship-types.cypher

# 3. Install Neo4j driver
npm install neo4j-driver

# 4. Run tests
npm run test:knowledge-graph

# 5. Start dev server with knowledge graph
npm start
```
