# Calendar Circuit Breaker Improvements

## Changes Made to Prevent False Positives on App Load

### 1. Added Grace Period
- After any circuit breaker reset, there's now a 10-second grace period
- During this grace period, all calendar event calls are allowed through
- This prevents the circuit breaker from activating during initial page load and React component lifecycle

### 2. Increased Rate Limit Threshold
- Changed loadEvents threshold from 3 calls in 5 seconds to 10 calls in 5 seconds
- This accounts for React's double-rendering in development mode and multiple components loading

### 3. Grace Period Implementation
```javascript
// Added to calendar state
lastResetTime: 0,
gracePeriodActive: false

// In resetCalendarCircuitBreaker
state.gracePeriodActive = true;
// Deactivate after 10 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  currentState.gracePeriodActive = false;
}, 10000);

// In checkCalendarEventGuard
if (state.gracePeriodActive) {
  console.log('ðŸŸ¢ Calendar event guard in grace period, allowing:', eventName);
  return false;
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **On Login/Family Load**: Circuit breaker is reset with a 10-second grace period
2. **During Grace Period**: All calendar operations are allowed (no blocking)
3. **After Grace Period**: Normal protection resumes with more reasonable thresholds
4. **Rate Limiting**: Increased to 10 calls per 5 seconds for loadEvents

## Result
- Users no longer see the orange notification when first entering the app
- Initial page load and React component mounting won't trigger false positives
- Genuine infinite loops are still caught after the grace period
- The system is more forgiving during startup but still protective against real issues

## Console Messages
You'll now see these messages during startup:
- `ðŸ“… Calendar Loop Guard: Circuit breaker fully reset at [timestamp]`
- `ðŸŸ¢ Calendar event guard in grace period, allowing: loadEvents`
- `ðŸ“… Calendar Loop Guard: Grace period ended` (after 10 seconds)
