# Knowledge Graph Integration Gaps - Critical Audit

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** üî¥ **CRITICAL GAPS FOUND**

---

## ‚úÖ What We Have

### 1. Claude Model
- **Model:** `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` (Claude Opus 4.1)
- **Location:** `/src/services/ClaudeService.js:17`
- **Usage:** Main Allie chat, internal users
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Most capable model

### 2. Real-Time Neo4j Sync (Oct 19)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**
- 5 Cloud Functions automatically sync Firestore ‚Üí Neo4j
- Johnson family: 544 nodes synced successfully
- Backend API: `/server/routes/knowledge-graph.js` (6 endpoints)

### 3. Knowledge Graph UI
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- D3.js visual graph (`VisualGraphMode.jsx`)
- Historical patterns panel
- Predictive insights panel
- Uses `KnowledgeGraphService.js` correctly

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS FOUND

### Gap #1: Allie Chat NOT Connected to Neo4j Knowledge Graph

**Problem:**
- `AllieConversationEngine.jsx` imports `QuantumKnowledgeGraph` (old Firestore-based system)
- Does NOT import or use `KnowledgeGraphService.js` (new Neo4j system)
- Allie cannot access real-time Neo4j insights

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
- Users ask "Who's our coordination bottleneck?" ‚Üí Allie has NO DATA
- Knowledge Graph tab shows insights, but Allie can't discuss them
- Disconnected user experience

**Location:**
```javascript
// AllieConversationEngine.jsx:18
import quantumKG from '../../../services/QuantumKnowledgeGraph'; // ‚ùå OLD
// MISSING: import knowledgeGraphService from '../../../services/KnowledgeGraphService';
```

**Fix Required:**
1. Import `KnowledgeGraphService` in `AllieConversationEngine.jsx`
2. Add KG context to Allie's system prompt
3. Add KG query capabilities to Allie's toolset
4. Enable Allie to answer questions like:
   - "Show me invisible labor patterns"
   - "Who creates the most tasks?"
   - "When do we create tasks?"
   - "What's our cognitive load distribution?"

---

### Gap #2: Multiple Conflicting KG Services

**Problem:** 7 different knowledge graph services exist:

| Service | Size | Status | Purpose |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| `QuantumKnowledgeGraph.js` | 93KB | ‚ùå OLD | Complex Firestore-based system (used by Allie) |
| `KnowledgeGraphService.js` | 7.7KB | ‚úÖ NEW | Neo4j API calls (used by KG UI) |
| `FamilyKnowledgeGraph.js` | 52KB | ‚ùì UNKNOWN | Unclear usage |
| `EnhancedKnowledgeGraphService.js` | 50KB | ‚ùì UNKNOWN | Unclear usage |
| `ComprehensiveKnowledgeGraphSync.js` | 17KB | ‚ùì UNKNOWN | Sync service? |
| `SurveyEngineKnowledgeGraphSync.js` | 25KB | ‚ùì UNKNOWN | Survey sync? |
| `SurveyKnowledgeGraphIntegration.js` | 15KB | ‚ùì UNKNOWN | Survey integration? |

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
- Confusing codebase
- Inconsistent data sources
- Maintenance burden
- Potential bugs from using wrong service

**Fix Required:**
1. Audit each service for usage
2. Deprecate unused services
3. Consolidate to single source of truth: `KnowledgeGraphService.js` ‚Üí Neo4j
4. Update all imports to use new service

---

### Gap #3: Allie's System Prompt Missing KG Context

**Problem:**
- Allie's system prompt doesn't mention Knowledge Graph capabilities
- No instructions on when/how to query KG data
- No examples of KG-powered responses

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
- Even if we connect KG service, Allie won't know to use it
- Users won't know to ask KG-related questions

**Fix Required:**
Add to Allie's system prompt:
```
You have access to the family's Knowledge Graph via the Knowledge Graph API:
- Invisible labor analysis (who notices/coordinates/monitors tasks)
- Cognitive load distribution (who's overwhelmed)
- Task creation patterns (when are tasks created most)
- Coordination bottlenecks (who everyone relies on)
- Predictive insights (burnout risks, upcoming conflicts)

When users ask about family patterns, workload distribution, or who does what,
use the Knowledge Graph to provide data-driven insights.

Examples:
- "Who's our coordination bottleneck?" ‚Üí Query KG coordination analysis
- "Show me invisible labor patterns" ‚Üí Query KG invisible labor
- "When do we create most tasks?" ‚Üí Query KG temporal patterns
```

---

### Gap #4: No KG Access from Other Tabs

**Problem:**
- Knowledge Graph only accessible from KG tab
- Users can't ask Allie about KG insights while in Calendar, Tasks, or Home tabs
- Must switch tabs to see insights

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
- Poor UX - users must context switch
- Allie feels disconnected from data

**Current State:**
```
User in Calendar tab ‚Üí Opens Allie ‚Üí Asks "Who creates most events?"
Allie's response: ‚ùå Generic answer (no KG data)

User in KG tab ‚Üí Opens Allie ‚Üí Asks same question
Allie's response: ‚úÖ Data-driven (has KG context)
```

**Fix Required:**
- Make `KnowledgeGraphService` globally available to Allie
- Add KG context regardless of current tab
- Allow seamless KG queries from anywhere

---

### Gap #5: Missing Comprehensive Test Suite

**Problem:**
- No tests for Cloud Function triggers
- No tests for Neo4j sync service
- No integration tests for Firestore ‚Üí Neo4j pipeline
- No E2E tests for KG + Allie integration

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
- Can't verify sync works correctly
- Risk of regressions when updating
- No confidence in production deployment

**Fix Required:**
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - `neo4j-sync.js` (transform functions, cognitive load calculation)
   - Cloud Function handlers

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Firestore write ‚Üí Cloud Function triggers ‚Üí Neo4j write
   - Full sync pipeline for each data type

3. **E2E Tests:**
   - User creates task ‚Üí Appears in KG tab
   - User asks Allie about task patterns ‚Üí Gets KG-powered answer
