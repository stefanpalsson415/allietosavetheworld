# Time-Bound Habits Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem
Many parental load tasks are time-bound activities that don't make sense as "2-minute habits":
- **Driving to Activities** - Can't drive somewhere in 2 minutes
- **Attending School Events** - Can't attend an event for 2 minutes  
- **Homework Help** - 2 minutes isn't meaningful help
- **Grocery Shopping** - Can't shop in 2 minutes
- **Home Repairs** - Most repairs take much longer
- **Doctor Appointments** - Can't have a 2-minute appointment

## Solution
Reframe these time-bound activities as **preparation habits** that support the main task.

## Implementation

### 1. **Detection Logic**
Added comprehensive detection for time-bound activities:
```javascript
const isTimeBoundActivity = 
  title.includes('driv') || 
  title.includes('transport') ||
  title.includes('attending') ||
  title.includes('school event') ||
  title.includes('grocery') ||
  title.includes('shopping') ||
  title.includes('doctor') ||
  title.includes('appointment') ||
  title.includes('repair') ||
  title.includes('homework help');
```

### 2. **Smart Reframing**
Each activity type gets specific reframing:
- **Driving** → "preparation aspect"
- **Events** → "preparation and follow-up"  
- **Homework** → "setting up for success"
- **Shopping** → "planning and list-making"
- **Repairs** → "organizing tools and supplies"

### 3. **Customized Suggestions**

#### Driving/Transportation
- Check tomorrow's schedule
- Pack activity bags
- Prep car snacks
- Set out keys

#### School Events
- Add to calendar
- Prep forms/items
- Set out clothes
- Photo event info

#### Homework Help
- Set up workspace
- Review assignments
- Prep study snacks
- Clear desk area

#### Grocery Shopping
- Check inventory
- Add to shopping list
- Review meal plan
- Prep reusable bags

#### Home Repairs
- Document the issue
- Add to repair list
- Check supplies
- Organize tools

### 4. **Improved User Experience**
- Allie now recognizes time-bound activities automatically
- Provides context-appropriate suggestions
- Makes "2-minute version" question sensible
- Focuses on preparation that actually helps

## Result
Now when users select habits like "Driving to Activities", they get meaningful preparation habits instead of confusing requests for "2-minute driving".

## Future Consideration
Consider preventing time-bound activities from being selected as habits in the first place, or clearly labeling them as "responsibilities" vs "habits" in the UI.
