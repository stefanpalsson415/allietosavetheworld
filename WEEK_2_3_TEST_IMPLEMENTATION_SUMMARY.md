## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS

### Tests Requiring Additional Setup (Week 2 & 3):
1. **Email parsing** - Needs test email sent to @families.checkallie.com inbox
2. **Photo OCR** - Needs test image files with text content
3. **Google Calendar OAuth** - Needs test Google account with calendar integration
4. **Voice recording** - Needs browser audio permission handling
5. **Historical data seeding** - Needs Firestore seed data from past weeks/months

### Scaffolded Tests (Need Full Implementation):
- Email event extraction (requires email backend working)
- Bidirectional Google Calendar sync (requires OAuth + EnhancedCalendarSyncService)
- Conflict detection (requires creating overlapping events)

### Authentication Prerequisites:
All tests currently assume:
- User is already logged in
- Test family exists with children
- Basic dashboard navigation works

**TODO:** Expand test setup/teardown framework to:
1. Create test family with pre-populated data
2. Seed historical check-ins and development records
3. Clean up test data after runs
