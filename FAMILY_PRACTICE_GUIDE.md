# Family Practice Sessions - Quick Guide

## What is a Family Practice Session?

It's a **5-10 minute window** where your family does a habit together, earning bonus rewards and strengthening the habit through teamwork.

## How to Run a Session:

### 1. **Someone Starts It**
- Parent or kid clicks "Start Family Practice Session"
- This sends a notification: "Mom started Mental Load practice! Join in the next 10 minutes!"

### 2. **Everyone Joins In**
- Family members see the notification
- They can join from their phone/device or just participate in person
- No video call needed - just do the habit!

### 3. **Practice Together**
Examples of what this looks like:
- **Mental Load Decisions**: Spend 5 minutes planning tomorrow together
- **Managing Schedules**: Review the week's calendar as a family
- **Evening Cleanup**: Set a timer, play music, everyone cleans one area
- **Morning Routine**: Everyone does their morning tasks simultaneously

### 4. **Earn Rewards**
- 2x XP for practicing together
- Unlock story chapters faster
- Kids see parents' "invisible work" in action
- Build family teamwork habits

## Real Example:

**6:30 PM**: Dad clicks "Start Family Practice Session" for "Evening Cleanup"
**6:31 PM**: Mom and kids get notification
**6:32 PM**: Dad puts on 5-minute cleanup music
**6:32-6:37 PM**: Everyone picks a room/area and cleans
**6:37 PM**: High-fives all around!
**6:38 PM**: Everyone marks "completed" in app
**Result**: Quest progresses, everyone earns XP, house is cleaner, kids learned responsibility

## Why It Works:

1. **Makes invisible work visible** - Kids see what parents do
2. **Builds habits together** - More fun than doing it alone
3. **Fixed time limit** - Not overwhelming (just 5-10 min)
4. **Gamification** - Points and progress make it engaging
5. **Flexibility** - Can be in-person or everyone in different rooms

## Tips:
- Pick a consistent time (after dinner, before bed)
- Make it fun with music or challenges
- Celebrate completion together
- Let kids take turns being the "session starter"
- Keep it short and sweet!

The goal isn't perfection - it's building consistent family habits together! ðŸŽ¯
