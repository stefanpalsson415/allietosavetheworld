## Problems Fixed

### ✅ Problem 1: SMS Auto-Processing Before Click

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

---

### ✅ Problem 2: Processing Hangs Forever
**Issue**: Processing spinner would hang indefinitely after processing an item.

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

### ✅ Problem 3: Calendar Event Button Opens EventDrawer

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

### ✅ Problem 4: Event Shown in "What Allie Did"
**Issue**: Calendar events weren't appearing in the "What Allie Did" completed actions section.

**Fix**: Replaced calendar action handler to directly create events with status='completed' instead of 'in-progress'.

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/inbox/UnifiedInbox.jsx` (lines 1463-1571)

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

---

### ✅ Problem 5: Task Due Date Parsing from Description

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/inbox/UnifiedInbox.jsx` (lines 1623-1654)

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

- `/src/components/inbox/UnifiedInbox.jsx` (lines 1656-1703)

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

---

### ✅ Problem 7: Contact Extraction (Coach Sara Not Sender)
**Issue**: System was saving sender's phone number as the contact's phone instead of the mentioned person.

- `/src/components/inbox/UnifiedInbox.jsx` (lines 1799-1827)

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

- `/src/services/BlogService.js` (lines 30-73)

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

---

### ✅ Problem 10: Delete Sample Blog Articles
**Issue**: Sample/test blog articles needed to be removed from production.

**Fix**: Created and ran deletion script; collection was already empty.

**Files Modified**:
- `/scripts/delete-sample-blog-posts.js` (new file)

**Status**: DEPLOYED ✅

These warnings do not affect functionality and are common in development code. They can be addressed in future cleanup iterations.

All fixes follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase:
- React functional components with hooks
- Proper error handling with try/catch
- Service layer separation
- Clear comments explaining logic
