# Inbox Drawer Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Add Contact Button Now Shows Form
- The "Add contact" button in the UnifiedInbox already dispatches the correct 'open-chat-event' 
- AllieChat's event handler creates a contact creation form message when receiving this event
- The ContactCreationForm component is already integrated into ChatMessage.jsx

### 2. View Buttons Fixed
- View buttons dispatch events instead of navigating
- Two different events are used:
  - 'open-chat-event' for "Do It" button actions
  - 'open-allie-chat' for "View" buttons in completed actions section

### 3. Chat Drawer Opening Issue
- **Root Cause**: AllieChat component was initializing its `isOpen` state to `false` regardless of props
- **Fix Applied**: Changed `useState(false)` to `useState(initialVisible || embedded || notionMode)`
- This ensures when AllieChat is rendered inside ChatDrawer (with `notionMode={true}` and `embedded={true}`), it's always visible

## Debug Logging Added
- Added console logs to track drawer state and openDrawer function calls
- Created test script at `/public/test-drawer-events.js` for debugging

## How It Works Now
1. User clicks "Add contact" → dispatches 'open-chat-event' → opens drawer → shows contact form
2. User clicks "View" → dispatches event → opens drawer → shows item details
3. AllieChat respects its props when inside ChatDrawer, ensuring proper visibility

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Go to the Document Hub / Inbox
2. Click "Add contact" on any suggested contact action - should open drawer with form
3. Click "View" on any completed action - should open drawer with details
4. No page refresh should occur
