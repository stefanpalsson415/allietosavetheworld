## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS

### Tests Requiring Additional Setup
1. **Multi-parent coordination** - Needs multi-session test framework
2. **Voice recording** - Needs browser audio permission handling
3. **Photo upload** - Needs test image files
4. **Historical data** - Needs Firestore seed data from past dates
5. **Child authentication** - Needs kid account login flow

### Scaffolded Tests (Need Implementation)
- Chore assignment flow (UI exploration needed)
- Child chore completion (kid login needed)
- Parent approval workflow (pending approval UI)
- Full E2E chore-to-reward cycle (most complex, highest value)

### Authentication Prerequisites
All tests currently assume:
- User is already logged in
- Test family exists with children
- Basic dashboard navigation works

**TODO:** Create test setup/teardown that:
1. Creates test family
2. Logs in as test user
3. Seeds required data
4. Cleans up after tests
