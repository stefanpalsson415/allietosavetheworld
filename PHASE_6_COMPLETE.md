## 🔧 Integration with Existing Allie Agent

### **Add to Agent Handler**

```javascript
// In server/handlers/agent-handler.js
const PredictiveSuggestionEngine = require('../services/PredictiveSuggestionEngine');

class AgentHandler {
  constructor() {
    // ... existing services
    this.suggestionEngine = new PredictiveSuggestionEngine();
  }

  async processMessage(message, userId, familyId, context) {
    // ... existing message processing

    // Generate proactive suggestions
    if (context.enablePredictiveSuggestions !== false) {
      const suggestions = await this.suggestionEngine.generateSuggestions(familyId, {
        currentMessage: message,
        userId,
        timestamp: new Date()
      });

      // Include top suggestions in response
      if (suggestions.suggestions.length > 0) {
        const topSuggestions = suggestions.suggestions.slice(0, 3);
        response.suggestions = topSuggestions;
      }
    }

    return response;
  }
}
```

### **Add API Endpoints**

```javascript
// In server/production-server.js

// Get predictive suggestions
app.post('/api/suggestions/generate', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { familyId, context } = req.body;
    const suggestions = await suggestionEngine.generateSuggestions(familyId, context);
    res.json(suggestions);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Track suggestion interactions
app.post('/api/suggestions/interact', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { suggestionId, interaction } = req.body;
    await suggestionEngine.trackSuggestionInteraction(suggestionId, interaction);
    res.json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Get suggestion effectiveness
app.get('/api/suggestions/effectiveness/:familyId', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { familyId } = req.params;
    const { days } = req.query;
    const effectiveness = await suggestionEngine.getSuggestionEffectiveness(familyId, parseInt(days) || 30);
    res.json(effectiveness);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```
