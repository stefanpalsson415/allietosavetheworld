## Usage

The Knowledge Graph is now accessible from the main navigation sidebar. It will automatically load all family data and generate insights when opened. Users can:

- Search for any entity (person, task, event, etc.)
- Filter by entity types and relationships
- Click on nodes to see detailed information
- View AI-generated insights and predictions
- Refresh the graph to get latest data

The graph provides "the most powerful tool for any family" by connecting all data sources and revealing hidden patterns and relationships.
