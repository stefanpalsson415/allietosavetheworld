## ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES (Phases 1-3)

### Phase 1: Invisible Labor Foundation ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE - Production-ready services

#### Files Created:
1. **`server/services/graph/invisibleLabor/InvisibleLaborEngine.js`** (485 lines)
   - Anticipation burden analysis (60-70% cognitive labor)
   - Monitoring overhead ("nagging coefficient")
   - Decision-research gap detection
   - Task creation vs execution split (60/40 weighting)
   - Fair Play phase distribution analysis
   - Comprehensive report generation with severity scoring
   - Natural language insights

2. **`server/services/graph/invisibleLabor/DataAggregationService.js`** (450 lines)
   - Multi-source data fusion (7+ Firestore collections)
   - Real-time sync: Task ‚Üí Neo4j
   - Batch sync: Daily 3am full sync
   - On-demand sync for insights
   - Entity mapping (Firestore ‚Üî Neo4j)
   - Fair Play card auto-assignment
   - Relationship creation (ANTICIPATES, MONITORS, etc.)

#### What It Does:
- **Makes invisible labor visible** - Quantifies who notices tasks, follows up, researches decisions
- **Gini coefficient calculation** - Measures inequality in task distribution
- **Severity scoring** - High/medium/low for each metric
- **Actionable recommendations** - Specific steps to reduce burden

---

### Phase 2: Child Insights + Coordination Analysis ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE - World-changing features ready

#### Files Created:

   - **WORLD-CHANGING FEATURE:** Deep psychological child profiles
   - Behavioral pattern analysis (activities, tasks, observations)
   - Hidden talent detection (>20% activity concentration)
   - Emerging challenge identification (before problems escalate)
   - Developmental milestone tracking (age-appropriate)
   - Emotional pattern analysis (sentiment scoring)
   - Claude-powered narrative insights
   - Actionable parenting recommendations

2. **`server/services/graph/coordination/DependencyAnalyzer.js`** (485 lines)

   - Critical path identification (longest chains)
   - Ripple effect analysis (cascading disruptions)
   - Severity scoring + recommendations

#### What It Does:
**Child Insights:**
- Analyzes ALL family data (tasks, events, conversations, interviews)
- Detects hidden talents parents might not see
- Identifies challenges before they become problems
- Generates warm, hopeful psychological insights via Claude
- Provides specific parenting actions (not generic advice)

**Coordination Analysis:**
- Finds who is the coordination bottleneck (high betweenness)
- Maps dependency chains (who blocks whom)
- Detects fragmented task communities (context-switching burden)
- Calculates ripple effects (cascading impacts)

---

### Phase 3: Entity Resolution + Temporal Patterns ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE - Data quality + time-series analysis ready

#### Files Created:
1. **`server/services/graph/entityResolution/EntityResolutionService.js`** (485 lines)
   - Jaro-Winkler string similarity algorithm
   - Multi-source entity merging ("Mom", "Sarah", "sarah@email")
   - Task deduplication ("grocery shopping" = "buy groceries")
   - Confidence scoring (0.85+ high, 0.7-0.85 medium, <0.7 low)
   - Caching for performance
   - Duplicate person/task detection
   - Collective entity resolution (uses relationship context)

2. **`server/services/graph/temporalPatterns/TemporalPatternDetector.js`** (520 lines)
   - **Sunday night planning spike detection** (research-backed)
   - Day-of-week pattern analysis

   - Stress pattern identification (monitoring burden by day)
   - Weekly rhythm analysis (consistency scoring)
   - Time-of-day event clustering

#### What It Does:
**Entity Resolution:**
- Prevents duplicate people ("Mom" vs "Sarah Johnson")
- Merges duplicate tasks (fuzzy matching)
- Improves data quality for accurate insights
- Caches resolutions for speed

**Temporal Patterns:**
- Reveals WHEN invisible labor happens ("68% of tasks created Sunday night")
- Detects stress days (highest monitoring burden)
- Identifies seasonal surges (back-to-school +40% tasks)
- Measures weekly rhythm variability (creates stress when >0.5)

## ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS (Phases 4-5)

### Phase 4: Recommendations + Fairness Metrics
**Status:** NOT STARTED - Next to build

#### Planned Files:

## üéØ What This Enables RIGHT NOW

Even without Phases 4-5 (Recommendations + UI), the backend can ALREADY:

### Invisible Labor Insights:
```javascript
const analysis = await invisibleLaborEngine.getComprehensiveReport('johnson_family_001');

// Returns:
{
  anticipation: {
    primaryAnticipator: { name: "Sarah", percentage: 68, tasksAnticipated: 21 },
    anticipationGap: 0.42,  // Gini coefficient
    insight: "Sarah notices 68% of tasks... significant invisible labor",
    severity: "high",
    recommendation: "Share anticipation responsibilities..."
  },
  monitoring: {
    naggingCoefficient: 3.2,  // hours/week
    insight: "Sarah spends 3.2 hours/week following up...",
    severity: "high"
  },
  overallSeverity: "high",
  topRecommendations: [...]
}
```

### Child Insights:
```javascript
const profile = await childInsightEngine.generateChildProfile('johnson_family_001', 'child_emma_001');

// Returns:
{
  child: { name: "Emma", age: 12 },
  profile: {
    behavioral: {
      activities: [{ name: "art", count: 15, percentage: 30 }],
      tasks: { completionRate: 78 }
    },
    talents: [{
      talent: "art",
      confidence: 0.85,
      recommendation: "Consider advanced art classes or mentorship"
    }],
    challenges: [{
      challenge: "Perfectionism stress",
      severity: "medium",
      recommendation: "Review with child psychologist"
    }]
  },
  insights: "Emma shows exceptional artistic talent... [Claude-generated narrative]",
  recommendations: [...]
}
```

### Coordination Analysis:
```javascript
const coordination = await dependencyAnalyzer.analyzeCoordinationPatterns('johnson_family_001');

// Returns:
{
  bottlenecks: {
    primaryBottleneck: { name: "Sarah", score: 0.58 },
    insight: "Sarah is critical coordination hub... potential bottleneck",
    severity: "high"
  },
  dependencies: {
    totalChains: 12,
    primaryBlocker: { person: "Sarah", chainsBlocked: 8 }
  }
}
```

### Temporal Patterns:
```javascript
const patterns = await temporalPatternDetector.analyzeTemporalPatterns('johnson_family_001');

// Returns:
{
  taskCreation: {
    sundayNightSpike: true,
    sundayNightPercentage: 34,
    insight: "68% of tasks created Sunday 6pm-11pm... invisible planning labor"
  },
  stress: {
    highestStressDay: { day: "Monday", percentage: 28 }
  },
  seasonal: {
    backToSchoolSpike: true
  }
}
```
