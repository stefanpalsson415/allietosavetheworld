### Security Rule Limitations

- ‚ùå `weeklyCheckIns` (not defined in firestore.rules)
- ‚ùå `familyMeetings` (not defined in firestore.rules)
- ‚ùå `inboxMessages` (not defined in firestore.rules)
- ‚ùå `chatMessages` (requires family membership validation)

- ‚ùå `growthRecords` (not defined in firestore.rules)
- ‚ùå `academicRecords` (not defined in firestore.rules)

**Note:** These could be added manually later if needed, but the family already has enough data to demonstrate all major features.

```

## Re-running the Script
The script is idempotent for users (skips if exists) but will CREATE NEW DATA each time for events, tasks, etc.

**To reset:**
1. Delete Martinez family document in Firestore
2. Delete Sofia and David users in Firebase Auth
3. Delete all associated events/tasks/documents
4. Re-run script: `node scripts/create-martinez-demo-family.js`

## Technical Details

### Firebase Configuration
- Project ID: `parentload-ba995`
- Region: `us-central1`
- Authentication: Email/Password
- Database: Firestore

### Data Structure Patterns
- **Timestamps:** All use `Timestamp.fromDate()` for Firestore compatibility
- **familyId:** Always included for security rule validation
- **userId:** Required for events (Firestore query requirement)
- **Arrays:** familyMembers stored as array (not object) for FamilyContext compatibility

### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ **1,927 total data items** created
- ‚úÖ **1 year of data** (Oct 2024 - Oct 2025)
- ‚úÖ **5 family members** (2 parents, 3 kids)
- ‚úÖ **All major features** represented
- ‚úÖ **Realistic patterns** throughout
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** demo data

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
To make the demo even more comprehensive, you could manually add:
1. Chat conversation history with Allie
2. Fair Play assessment responses
3. Weekly check-in survey data
4. Family meeting notes
5. Inbox messages (email/SMS processed items)
6. Provider contacts (doctors, teachers, coaches)
7. Child growth tracking records
8. Academic progress reports

**Note:** These require either updating Firestore security rules OR using Firebase Admin SDK to bypass rules.

## Summary
The Martinez demo family is **production-ready** with nearly 2,000 data items showing 1 year of active Allie usage. Perfect for demos, testing, and showcasing all major features!
