# Calendar V2 JavaScript Conversion Status

## âœ… What We've Fixed

1. **Removed all TypeScript syntax**:
   - Interfaces and type declarations
   - Type annotations on functions and variables
   - Generic type parameters
   - Type imports

2. **Fixed syntax errors**:
   - Removed dangling `>;` from removed generics
   - Fixed broken `useRef` declarations
   - Removed interface property declarations
   - Cleaned up malformed function signatures

3. **Calendar V2 is now pure JavaScript** and should compile without TypeScript errors

## ðŸ”§ What Might Still Need Work

1. **Runtime errors**: Without types, some runtime errors might occur
2. **Missing dependencies**: Some imports might need adjustment
3. **API integrations**: Claude API, Google Calendar, etc. might need testing
4. **CSS styling**: Some styles might need tweaking

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist

- [ ] App compiles without errors
- [ ] Calendar tab loads
- [ ] Can create events with natural language
- [ ] Calendar grid displays correctly
- [ ] Event cards show up
- [ ] Can click on events to see details
- [ ] Voice input works (if available)
- [ ] OCR feature works (if available)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Test all calendar features
2. Fix any runtime errors that appear
3. Ensure all integrations work properly
4. Style adjustments as needed

The calendar is now in JavaScript and ready for testing!
