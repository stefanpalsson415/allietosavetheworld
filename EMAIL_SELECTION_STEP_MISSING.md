# Email Selection Step Missing - Investigation Summary

## Issue
The email selection step (step 12) where users should see "palsson@families.checkallie.com" is being skipped in the onboarding flow.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Step Structure
- Total steps: 13
- Step 11: Phone verification
- Step 12: Email selection (EmailSelectionStep component)
- Step 13: Final confirmation

### 2. Button Logic Issue
The button on step 11 shows "Continue" correctly, but:
- On step 12, the button shows "Finish" (because `step === totalSteps - 1`)
- This is confusing because step 12 is NOT the final step

### 3. Navigation Flow
When on step 11 and clicking "Continue":
- It should go to step 12 (email selection)
- From step 12, clicking should go to step 13 (confirmation)

### 4. Debug Logs Added
Added console logs to track:
```javascript
console.log(`Advancing from step ${step} to step ${step + 1}`);
console.log(`Rendering step ${step} of ${totalSteps}`);
```

## Potential Causes

1. **Button Text Confusion**: Step 12 shows "Finish" which might make it seem like the final step
2. **State Issue**: The step might be incrementing twice somehow
3. **Validation**: Step 11 validation might be causing issues

## To Verify
Check the browser console when going through onboarding to see:
1. What step numbers are being rendered
2. If step 12 is being rendered at all
3. If there are any errors when transitioning from step 11 to 12

## Expected Behavior
- Step 11: Phone verification → Click "Continue"
- Step 12: Email selection shows with "palsson@families.checkallie.com" → Click "Continue"
- Step 13: Final confirmation → Click "Finish"
