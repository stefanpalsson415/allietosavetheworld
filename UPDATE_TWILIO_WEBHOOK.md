# Update Twilio Webhook for Production SMS

## Your SMS is now ready for production! 

### Step 1: Update Twilio Webhook ✅

1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Navigate to **Phone Numbers** → **Manage** → **Active Numbers**
3. Click on your number: **+1 (719) 748-6209**
4. In the **Messaging Configuration** section:
   - **A message comes in**: 
     - Webhook: `https://europe-west1-parentload-ba995.cloudfunctions.net/twilioSMS`
     - HTTP Method: `POST`
   - Click **Save Configuration**

### Step 2: Test Your SMS Integration

1. From your verified phone (731536304), send a text to **+1 (719) 748-6209**:
   - "Remind me to pick up groceries"
   - "Doctor appointment tomorrow at 2pm"
   - "Tegner has soccer practice at 4pm"

2. Check the Unified Inbox in your app - messages should appear there
3. Allie will process the message and create suggested actions
4. You should receive a confirmation SMS back

### How It Works Now (Production)

1. **You text Allie** → Twilio receives the SMS
2. **Twilio calls Firebase Function** → `twilioSMS` function processes it
3. **Function saves to Firestore** → SMS appears in `smsInbox` collection
4. **Claude AI analyzes** → Extracts tasks, appointments, reminders
5. **UnifiedInbox displays** → Shows SMS with suggested actions
6. **Allie responds** → Sends confirmation SMS back to you

### Features Available

- **Reminders**: "Remind me to...", "Don't forget..."
- **Appointments**: "Doctor appointment", "Meeting at..."
- **Activities**: "Soccer practice", "Piano lesson"
- **MMS Support**: Send photos of schedules, flyers, documents

### Troubleshooting

If SMS not working:
1. Check Firebase Function logs:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --only twilioSMS
   ```

2. Verify webhook URL in Twilio matches exactly:
   ```
   https://europe-west1-parentload-ba995.cloudfunctions.net/twilioSMS
   ```

3. Ensure your phone is verified in the app

### Recent Updates (Dec 3, 2025)

- **Improved Phone Matching**: Function now handles multiple phone formats:
  - With/without country code (+1)
  - 10-digit and 11-digit formats
  - Checks both `phoneNumber` and `phone` fields
  - Checks both members subcollection and members array

- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added detailed logging for phone matching process

- **Production Ready**: Function deployed and accessible at the webhook URL

### Next Steps

The SMS integration is production-ready! However:

1. **Verify Twilio Webhook**: Please confirm the webhook URL is correctly set in Twilio Console
2. **Check Phone Format**: Your phone might be stored differently in the database
3. **Send Real SMS**: Text the Twilio number to test the complete flow

### Security Note

Your Twilio credentials are securely stored in Firebase Functions config. The production system is fully isolated from local development.
