# Knowledge Graph Power Features

## Overview
The Enhanced Knowledge Graph has been transformed from a simple visualization tool into a powerful analytical engine that provides deep insights, predictions, and actionable recommendations for families.

## Key Features

### 1. Mental Load Analysis
The system now calculates and visualizes mental load distribution across family members:
- **Task Load**: Based on task weight, priority, and complexity
- **Emotional Load**: Derived from children's emotional states and needs
- **Coordination Load**: Based on event complexity and number of attendees
- **Base Load**: Inherent parental responsibilities

Mental load insights appear in the AI Intelligence panel with visual progress bars showing load distribution.

### 2. Context Stitching
Ask complex, multi-hop questions about your family data:
- "Who helped with homework last week and what rewards did they earn?"
- "What activities overlap with doctor appointments?"
- "Which children are teaching their siblings?"
- "Show me all tasks assigned to Mom that are overdue"

Access via the "Context Query" button in Quick Actions.

### 3. Advanced Pattern Detection
The system automatically detects:
- **Task Imbalances**: Uneven distribution of responsibilities
- **Upcoming Overload**: Busy periods with too many events
- **Sibling Dynamics**: Teaching relationships and positive interactions
- **Health Patterns**: Overdue checkups and medical needs
- **Financial Trends**: Spending patterns and savings opportunities

### 4. Predictive Analytics
The Knowledge Graph predicts:
- **Task Overload**: Warns when someone will have too many tasks
- **Sibling Conflicts**: Identifies when siblings need more positive interaction
- **Emotional Support Needs**: Detects when children need extra attention
- **Wardrobe Updates**: Reminds when clothing sizes need updating

### 5. Anomaly Detection
Automatically identifies:
- Missing medical checkups
- Unusual task volumes
- Social isolation risks
- Schedule conflicts

### 6. Privacy-Preserving Intelligence
The system can share anonymized patterns with other families while protecting privacy:
- Family size and composition (anonymized)
- Task distribution patterns
- Sibling dynamics effectiveness
- Peak activity times

## How to Use

### Accessing Advanced Features
1. Go to the Knowledge Graph tab in your dashboard
2. Click "Analyze Patterns" to run a comprehensive analysis
3. Check the AI Intelligence panel for insights and predictions
4. Use "Context Query" to ask specific questions

### Understanding the Visualizations
- **Node Size**: Indicates number of connections (more connected = larger)
- **Node Color**: Represents entity type (people, tasks, events, etc.)
- **Link Thickness**: Shows relationship strength
- **Mental Load Bars**: Display load distribution (purple bars in insights)

### Quick Actions
- **Find Path**: Discover how two entities are connected
- **Analyze Patterns**: Run comprehensive analysis including mental load
- **Context Query**: Ask complex questions about relationships
