## 🔧 Final Setup Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Missing Firestore Index

**Required Index**: `procedural_memory` composite index

**Option A: Auto-Create via URL** (Recommended)
```
Visit this URL and click "Create":
https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/parentload-ba995/firestore/indexes?create_composite=Clpwcm9qZWN0cy9wYXJlbnRsb2FkLWJhOTk1L2RhdGFiYXNlcy8oZGVmYXVsdCkvY29sbGVjdGlvbkdyb3Vwcy9wcm9jZWR1cmFsX21lbW9yeS9pbmRleGVzL18QARoMCghmYW1pbHlJZBABGg8KC3N1Y2Nlc3NSYXRlEAIaEgoOZXhlY3V0aW9uQ291bnQQAhoMCghfX25hbWVfXxAC
```

**Option B: Manual Creation**
1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore > Indexes
2. Click "Create Index"
3. Collection Group: `procedural_memory`
4. Add fields:
   - `familyId` (Ascending)
   - `successRate` (Descending)
   - `executionCount` (Descending)
5. Click "Create"

### Step 2: Test Index Creation
```bash
cd server && node create-procedural-index.js
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Cloud Run (Optional)
```bash
# If you want to deploy the agent endpoint to production
gcloud run deploy allie-claude-api \
  --source=/Users/stefanpalsson/parentload\ copy/parentload-clean/server \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --platform=managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

---

## 🧪 Verification Tests

### Test 1: Basic Agent Functionality
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/claude/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Schedule a dentist appointment tomorrow at 2pm",
    "userId": "test_user",
    "familyId": "test_family",
    "context": {"userName": "Test User", "familyName": "Test Family"}
  }'
```

**Expected Response**: Agent creates event with `<thinking>` block visible

### Test 2: Complex Multi-Step Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/claude/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Add milk and eggs to grocery list and remind me to go shopping tomorrow",
    "userId": "test_user",
    "familyId": "test_family",
    "context": {"userName": "Test User", "familyName": "Test Family"}
  }'
```

**Expected Response**: Agent creates list items and task with reasoning visible

### Test 3: Reasoning Quality Test
```bash
cd server && node test-reasoning.js
```

**Expected Output**: Reasoning capabilities score >60%
